# some readmes might contain authors in readmes, also in dependencies for weird reasons!
# use llm to first summarize readme for installation process or link(any of it), keywords, authors, maintainers(if mentioned)
# use llm to get authors, maintainers from dependencies, sometimes it is case, toml files can have authors, maintainers
# try to move to go because of goroutines, then api calling is async, maybe python as it as well

# toml, xml, 

# what is most important at first?
# ["name", "description", "url", "license", "latest_version", "topics", "languages", "readme", "codemeta", "dependencies"]
# from readme get installation process or link if found, and keywords
# dependencies
# if codemeta found, get authors, contributors, id, or represent each attribute of it on frontend


# from readme, dependencies, codemeta ask llm to get installation, keywords, dependencies, authors, contributors, developers, maintainer, funder, doi
# datecreated, published from rest api
