Additional steps and drivers are required, see .\nDocker: see .\n\nExecuting PCM tools under non-root user on Linux\nExecuting PCM tools under an unprivileged user on a Linux operating system is feasible. However, there are certain prerequisites that need to be met, such as having Linux perf_event support for your processor in the Linux kernel version you are currently running. To successfully run the PCM tools, you need to set the `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` setting to -1 as root once:\n\nand configure two specific environment variables when running the tools under a non-root user:\n\nFor instance, you can execute the following commands to set the environment variables and run pcm:\n\nor (to run the pcm sensor server as non-root):\n\nPlease keep in mind that when executing PCM tools under an unprivileged user on Linux, certain PCM metrics may be unavailable. This limitation specifically affects metrics that rely solely on direct MSR (Model-Specific Register) register access. Due to the restricted privileges of the user, accessing these registers is not permitted, resulting in the absence of corresponding metrics.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nPCM's frequently asked questions (FAQ) are located .\n\nPCM API documentation\nPCM API documentation is embedded in the source code and can be generated into html format from source using Doxygen (www.doxygen.org).\n\nPCM environment variables\nThe list of PCM environment variables is located \n\nCustom compilation options\nThe list of custom compilation options is located \n\nPackaging\nPackaging with CPack is supported on Debian and Redhat/SUSE system families.\nTo create DEB of RPM package need to call cpack after building in build folder:\n\nThis creates package:\n\"pcm-VERSION-Linux.deb\" on Debian family systems;\n\"pcm-VERSION-Linux.rpm\" on Redhat/SUSE-family systems.\nPackages contain pcm-\\binaries and required for usage opCode-\\files.\""

It is pronounced \"pipes-ah\".\n\nPyPSA is an open source toolbox for simulating and optimising modern power and energy systems that include features such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind and solar generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. PyPSA is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.\n\nThis project is maintained by the Department of Digital Transformation in Energy Systems at the Technical University of Berlin. Previous versions were developed by the Energy System Modelling group at the Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology funded by the European Union, and by the Renewable Energy Group at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies to carry out simulations for the European Energy Community, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the Stromnetze Research Initiative.\n\nPyPSA can calculate:\n\nstatic power flow (using both the full non-linear network equations and the linearised network equations)\n\nlinear optimal power flow (least-cost optimisation of power plant and storage dispatch within network constraints, using the linear network equations, over several snapshots)\n\nsecurity-constrained linear optimal power flow\n\ntotal electricity/energy system least-cost investment optimisation (using linear network equations, over several snapshots and investment periods simultaneously for optimisation of generation and storage dispatch and investment in the capacities of generation, storage, transmission and other infrastructure)\n\nIt has models for:\n\nmeshed multiply-connected AC and DC networks, with controllable converters between AC and DC networks\n\nstandard types for lines and transformers following the implementation in powergridmodel\n\nconventional dispatchable generators and links with unit commitment\n\ngenerators with time-varying power availability, such as wind and solar generators\n\nstorage units with efficiency losses\n\nsimple hydroelectricity with inflow and spillage\n\ncoupling with other energy carriers (e.g. resistive Power-to-Heat (P2H), Power-to-Gas (P2G), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), Fischer-Tropsch, direct air capture (DAC))\n\nbasic components out of which more complicated assets can be built, such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units and heat pumps.\n\nTo install PyPSA, use pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pypsa\n```\n\nor conda/mamba:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge pypsa\n```\n\nAdditionally, install a solver (see https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#solvers).\n\nThere are [more extensive examples](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples-basic.html) available as notebooks. They are also available as Python scripts in the `examples` directory.\n\nPyPSA is written and tested to be compatible with Python 3.9 and above. The last release supporting Python 2.7 was PyPSA 0.15.\n\nIt leans heavily on the following Python packages:\n\n- pandas for storing data about components and time series\n- numpy for calculations, such as linear algebra and sparse matrix calculations\n- networkx for some network calculations\n- matplotlib for static plotting\n- pyomo for preparing optimisation problems (currently only linear and mixed integer linear optimisation)\n- geopandas for plotting the baselayer map\n- pytest for unit testing\n- click for managing messages\n\nFind the full list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file.\n\nThe optimisation uses interface libraries like `linopy` which are independent of the preferred solver. You can use e.g. one of the free solvers glpk, cplex, and gurobi, or the commercial solver Gurobi for which free academic licenses are available.\n\nWe strongly welcome anyone interested in contributing to this project. If you have any ideas, suggestions or encounter problems, feel invited to file issues or make pull requests on GitHub.\n\nIn case of code-related questions, please post on Stack Overflow.\n\nFor non-programming related and more general questions please refer to the community forum.\n\nTo discuss with other PyPSA users, organise projects, share news, and get in touch with the community you can use the PyPSA Google Group.\n\nFor bugs and feature requests, please use the issue tracker.\n\nFor troubleshooting, please check the troubleshooting section in the documentation.\n\nDetailed guidelines can be found in the Contributing section of our documentation.\n\nPlease respect our guidelines.\n\nIf you use PyPSA for your research, we would appreciate it if you would cite the following paper:\n\nT.

This integration supports it but if you run an older version your devices may not work. Please keep this integration up to date by using HACS!\n\nAlthough the integration works using LAN, the tapo device needs internet access to synchronize with tapo cloud, especially for credentials, a missing internet access could lead into \"Invalid authentication error\". A static IP must be set for device.\n\nFor some unknown reason email with capital letters throw an \"Invalid authentication\" error. Before opening a new issue check your email address on Tapo App Settings. If your email contains capital letters, the integration won't work. I've opened an issue that explains this , I will fix asap. As a workaround you can create a new account using all lower-case in your email address.\n\nThe integration now supports native tapo discovery!

The integration allows Home Assistant to connect in direct-mode over the local network to the collector to extract the information, and no cables are required.\n\nIt has been created with a 5kW DEYE/SUNSYNK inverter and since integrated with a variety of other inverters that uses the Solarman data collector.\n\nThis component uses Pysolarman by Jonathan McCrohan for the underlying protocol, and also provides service-access to the library for advanced users. See https://github.com/jonathan-mccrohan/pysolarman.\n\nFeel free to discuss the integration by joining the Home Assistant community forums.\n\nThis method is prefered.\n\nFor this, it is highly recomended to use the \"Samba share\" add-on (you will need to enable advanced mode in your user profile).\n\nClone or download the repo, and copy the \"solarman\" folder in \"custom_components\" to the \"custom_components\" folder in home assistant.\n\nAfter that, the folder structure should look as follows:\n\n```\nconfig/custom_components/solarman/\n```\n\nGet the IP and Serial Number to use in the configuration.\n\nFind the internal IP of the logger on the DHCP server, and then open a browser and navigate to that address. If you are prompted for a username/password, use \"admin\" as username and \"admin\" as password.\n\nOnce logged in, expand the \"Device information\" and note the Device serial number, as well as the IP used.\n\nCheck the version of the solarman logger. If the serial number starts with 17xxxxxxx, 21xxxxxxx or 40xxxxxxx (protocol V5), the component should work. If not, you may need to try the component for V4 of the protocol mentioned above.\n\nOn your DHCP server, reserve the IP for the WiFi data logger so that it will not change.\n\nThis integration can be configured using config-flow, or by manually configuring using the configuration.yaml file. Both methods are described below:\n\nAfter the installation of this component, click on the \"Configuration\" tab on the left, then on \"Devices & Services\".\nSelect the \"Integrations\" tab on the top of the screen, then on the \"ADD INTEGRATION\" button on the left-hand corner.\nSelect the solarman integration.\n\nConfigure the entity by filling in the details.\n\nIn your configuration.yaml file, add the solarman platform under \"sensor\".\n\n| Parameter           | Description                                                             |\n| ------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| name                | This name will be prefixed to all parameter values (change as you like) |\n| inverter_host       | The IP address of the data logger.

The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability.\n\nThe model is described in the and in the paper PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System, 2018. The model building routines are defined through a snakemake workflow. Please see the for installation instructions and other useful information about the snakemake workflow. The model is designed to be imported into the open toolbox PyPSA.\n\n**WARNING**: PyPSA-Eur is under active development and has several issues which you should understand before using the model. The github repository collects known topics we are working on (please feel free to help or make suggestions). The documentation remains somewhat patchy. You can find showcases of the model's capabilities in the Joule paper The potential role of a hydrogen network in Europe, another paper in Joule with a description of the industry sector, or in a 2021 presentation at EMP-E. We do not recommend to use the full resolution network model for simulations. At high granularity the assignment of loads and generators to the nearest network node may not be a correct assumption, depending on the topology of the underlying distribution grid, and local grid bottlenecks may cause unrealistic load-shedding or generator curtailment. We recommend to cluster the network to a couple of hundred nodes to remove these local inconsistencies. See the discussion in Section 3.4 \"Model validation\" of the paper.\n\nThe dataset consists of:\n\nA grid model based on a modified Open Power System Data extraction of the ENTSO-E Transmission System Map. The grid model contains 7072 lines (alternating current lines at and above 220kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines) and 3803 substations. The open power plant database. Electrical demand time series from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Energy. Renewable time series based on ERA5 and SARAH, assembled using the PyPSA-Eur Tools. Geographical potentials for wind and solar generators based on land use (CORINE) and excluding nature reserves (Natura2000) are computed with the PyPSA-Eur Tools.\n\nA sector-coupled extension adds demand and supply for the following sectors: transport, space and water heating, biomass, industry and industrial feedstocks, agriculture, forestry and fishing. This completes the energy system and includes all greenhouse gas emitters except waste management and land use.\n\nThis diagram gives an overview of the sectors and the links between them:\n\nEach of these sectors is built up on the transmission network nodes from :\n\nFor computational reasons the model is usually clustered down to 50-200 nodes.\n\nAlready-built versions of the model can be found in the accompanying Zenodo repository.\n\nWe strongly welcome anyone interested in contributing to this project.

There are no planned updates as of this time (early 2022). The last version of this database is version 1.3. If we learn of active forks or maintained versions of the code and database we will attempt to provide links in the future.\n\nThis project aims to build . It is the result of a large collaboration involving many partners, coordinated by the  and . If you would like to get involved, please  or fork the repo and code! To learn more about how to contribute to this repository, read the  document.\n\nThe latest database release (v1.3.0) is available in CSV format  under a . A bleeding-edge version is in the  directory of this repo.\n\nAll Python source code is available under a .\n\nThis work is made possible and supported by , among other organizations.\n\nThe Global Power Plant Database is built in several steps.\n\nThe first step involves gathering and processing country-level data. In some cases, these data are read automatically from offical government websites; the code to implement this is in the `build_databases` directory. In other cases we gather country-level data manually. These data are saved in `raw_source_files/WRI` and processed with the `build_database_WRI.py` script in the `build_database` directory. \n\nThe second step is to integrate data from different sources, particularly for geolocation of power plants and annual total electricity generation. Some of these different sources are multi-national databases. For this step, we rely on offline work to match records; the concordance table mapping record IDs across databases is saved in resources/master_plant_concordance.csv.\n\nThroughout the processing, we represent power plants as instances of the `PowerPlant` class, defined in `powerplant_database.py`. The final database is in a flat-file CSV format.\n\nThe database includes the following indicators:\n\n- Plant name\n- Fuel type(s)\n- Generation capacity\n- Country\n- Ownership\n- Latitude/longitude of plant\n- Data source & URL\n- Data source year\n- Annual generation\n\nWe will expand this list in the future as we extend the database.\n\nWe define the \"Fuel Type\" attribute of our database based on common fuel categories. In order to parse the different fuel types used in our various data sources, we map fuel name synonyms to our fuel categories . We plan to expand the database in the future to report more disaggregated fuel types.\n\nA major challenge for this project is that data come from a variety of sources, including government ministries, utility companies, equipment manufacturers, crowd-sourced databases, financial reports, and more. The reliability of the data varies, and in many cases there are conflicting values for the same attribute of the same power plant from different data sources. To handle this, we match and de-duplicate records and then develop rules for which data sources to report for each indicator. We provide a clear  for each datum in the database. We plan to ultimately allow users to choose alternative rules for which data sources to draw on.\n\nTo the maximum extent possible, we read data automatically from trusted sources, and integrate it into the database. Our current strategy involves these steps:\n\n- Automate data collection from machine-readable national data sources where possible. \n- For countries where machine-readable data are not available, gather and curate power plant data by hand, and then match these power plants to plants in other databases, including GEO and CARMA (see below) to determine their geolocation.\n- For a limited number of countries with small total power-generation capacity, use data directly from Global Energy Observatory (GEO). \n\nA table describing the data source(s) for each country is listed below.\n\nFinally, we are examining ways to automatically incorporate data from the following supra-national data sources:\n\nWe assign a unique ID to each line of data that we read from each source. In some cases, these represent plant-level data, while in other cases they represent unit-level data. In the case of unit-level data, we commonly perform an aggregation step and assign a new, unique plant-level ID to the result. For plants drawn from machine-readable national data sources, the reference ID is formed by a three-letter country code  and a seven-digit number. For plants drawn from other database (including the manually-maintained dataset by WRI), the reference ID is formed by a variable-size prefix code and a seven-digit number.\n\nIn many cases our data sources do not include power plant geolocation information. To address this, we attempt to match these plants with the GEO and CARMA databases, in order to use that geolocation data. We use an  developed by Enipedia to perform the matching based on plant name, country, capacity, location, with confirmed matches stored in a concordance file. This matching procedure is complex and the algorithm we employ can sometimes wrongly match two power plants or fail to match two entries for the same power plant. We are investigating using the Duke framework for matching, which allows us to do the matching offline.\n\nThe build system is as follows\n\nCreate a virtual environment with Python 2.7 and the third-party packages in `requirements.txt`\n`cd` into `build_databases/`\nrun each `build_database_*.py` file for each data source or processing method that changed (when making a database update)\nrun `build_global_power_plant_database.py` which reads from the pickled store/sub-databases.\n`cd` into `../utils`\nrun `database_country_summary.py` to produce summary table\n`cd` into `../output_database`\ncopy `global_power_plant_database.csv` to the  repository. Look a the `Makefile` in that repo to understand where it should be located\nbuild new generation estimations as needed based on plant changes and updates compared to the stored and calculated values this is not automatic, but there are some helper scripts for making the estimates\nrun the `make_gppd.py` script in `gppd-ai4earth-api` to construct a new version of the database with the full estimation data\ncopy the new merged dataset back to this repo, increment the `DATABASE_VERSION` file, commit, etc...\""

Its primary focus is on planning energy systems at scales ranging from urban districts to entire continents. In an optional operational it can also test a pre-defined system under different operational conditions.\n\nA Calliope model consists of a collection of text files (in YAML and CSV formats) that fully define a model, with details on technologies, locations, resource potentials, etc. Calliope takes these files, constructs an optimization problem, solves it, and reports back results. Results can be saved to CSV or NetCDF files for further processing, or analysed directly in Python through Python's extensive scientific data processing capabilities provided by libraries like  and .\n\nCalliope comes with several built-in analysis and visualisation tools. Having some knowledge of the Python programming language helps when running Calliope and using these tools, but is not a prerequisite.\n\n\n\nCalliope can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Installing it is quickest with the `mamba` package manager by running a single command: `mamba create -c conda-forge -n calliope calliope`.\n\nSee the documentation for more .\n\nSeveral easy to understand example models are  and accessible through the `calliope.examples` submodule.\n\nThe . A good place to start is to look at these tutorials to get a feel for how Calliope works, and then to read the \"Introduction\", \"Building a model\", \"Running a model\", and \"Analysing a model\" sections in the online documentation.\n\nMore fully-featured examples that have been used in peer-reviewed scientific publications are available in our .\n\n\nDocumentation is available on .\n\n\nSee our documentation for more on how to .\n\n\nSee changes made in recent versions in the .\n\n\nIf you use Calliope for academic work please cite:\n\nStefan Pfenninger and Bryn Pickering (2018).

Climate change is a global issue that impacts all regions of the world and all sectors of the global economy. Thus, any responses to the threat of climate change, such as policies or international agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions, can have wide ranging consequences throughout the energy system as well as on land use and land cover. Integrated assessment models endeavor to represent all world regions and all sectors of the economy in an economic framework in order to explore interactions between sectors and understand the potential ramifications of climate mitigation actions.\n\nGCAM has been developed at PNNL for over 20 years and is now a freely available community model and documented online (See below). The team at JGCRI is comprised of economists, engineers, energy experts, forest ecologists, agricultural scientists, and climate system scientists who develop the model and apply it to a range of science and policy questions and work closely with Earth system and ecosystem modelers to integrate the human decision components of GCAM into their analyses.\n\nGCAM is a dynamic-recursive model with technology-rich representations of the economy, energy sector, land use and water linked to a climate model that can be used to explore climate change mitigation policies including carbon taxes, carbon trading, regulations and accelerated deployment of energy technology. Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions drive the energy and land-use systems employing numerous technology options to produce, transform, and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover. Using a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 at 5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to explore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and the greenhouse gas consequences of specific policy measures or energy technology adoption including; CO2 capture and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen systems, nuclear energy, renewable energy technology, and energy use technology in buildings, industry and the transportation sectors. GCAM is an Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-class model. This means it can be used to simulate scenarios, policies, and emission targets from various sources including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Output includes projections of future energy supply and demand and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, radiative forcing and climate effects of 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree resolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology, and climate mitigation policy.\n\nCalvin, K., Patel, P., Clarke, L., Asrar, G., Bond-Lamberty, B., Cui, R.

It then uses the defined register ledgers to create entities for each and every register provided by the GX device.\n\nPlease note that the integration is currently in an acceptance state. This means there are no breaking changes planned. If a breaking change were to be introduced, expect the release notes to reflect this. If you are missing a feature or experience any issues, please report them in the issue tracker.\n\nThe current state of this integration provides the following limitations regarding its use:\n- Configuring the integration will be relatively slow if a discovery scan is required.\n- This integration wasn't tested with a three-phase system. Although basic functionality should work, minor bugs could have gone unnoticed.\n\nThis integration was written and tested with the latest Victron firmware running.\n- GX version: v3.10 (support validated from v2.92)\n- Multiplus version: 492\n\nVictron continuously improves upon the Modbus implementation by adding new registers. Therefore, older firmware versions might not expose all registers this integration expects to be present. This might (depending on your firmware and connected devices) cause odd behavior where some but not all devices connected to your GX device will be correctly detected by this integration.\n\nThe best solution for this issue is to upgrade to the latest firmware. You can also open an issue to get your firmware version supported. This issue should contain the following information:\n- Connected devices\n- Firmware versions of the connected devices\n- Missing device type (grid, vebus, bms, can, etc.)\n- Missing unit ID (among other: 30, 100, 227, 228)\n\nPlease note that it might take some time for older firmware versions to get full support (after a ticket is opened).\n\n### Future Improvements\n- Fully switch to async\n- Investigate if a scan without causing (ignorable) errors at the GX device is possible\n- Improve connection loss resilience (mark/unmark availability of entities)\n- Revisit data types used for storing register info\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install this integration by following the steps for your preferred installation method.\n\n#### Requirements\n- This integration uses `pymodbus` 3.0.2 or higher.\n- As of November 2022, the built-in Home Assistant Modbus integration runs on a version < 3.0.0.\n- If you install this integration, the built-in Modbus integration will stop working due to breaking changes between 2.x.x and 3.0.0.\n\nStarting from Home Assistant core version 2023.2.x, the built-in Modbus integration now uses `pymodbus` version 3.1. Version 0.0.7 (and up) of this integration will also use the 3.1.1 `pymodbus` version.\n\nAlthough core version >= 2023.2 and previous versions of this integration should be compatible, it is recommended that all users update both core and this integration in the same patch round. Since having multiple library version requirements might cause the built-in 3.1.1 library to be overwritten by the 3.0.2 reference of versions 0.0.6 and earlier, this could cause issues if you are using specific configuration options of the built-in Modbus integration that weren't working with `pymodbus` 3.0.2 and were fixed in 3.1.1.\n\n#### Steps to Install\n1. Clone the repository to your machine.\n2. Copy the contents of `custom_components/` to your machine running Home Assistant.\n3. Restart Home Assistant.\n4. Go to \"Settings -> Devices and Services -> Integrations.\"\n5. Click on \"Add Integration.\"\n6. Search for \"Victron.\"\n7. Fill in the correct options and submit.\n\n### Adding the Integration Through a Link\nYou can also add the integration through this link:\n- Restart Home Assistant.\n- Setup integration via the integration page.\n\n### Integration Behavior\n- This integration scans for available units and register ranges upon installation and when selected in the options menu.\n- This will cause \"errors\" in the GX device under \"Settings -> Services -> Modbus TCP\" due to not every register set and unit being available (and Victron not providing a discover unit/register to query).\n- These errors can be cleared without any issue and should not be reported unless (after scanning) errors keep getting reported.\n\n### Important Notes\n- This integration speaks to the Victron GX device, which is an exposed integration point for a system capable of running on high voltages and currents. If the system were to become unstable, it might lead to damage of equipment, fires, and/or electrocution.\n- Although this integration speaks to the (exposed by Victron) ModbusTCP server, it might cause the system to become unstable in circumstances like (but not limited to):\n  - High request frequency\n  - Writing to write registers (for example, changing the ESS setpoint value).\n\n### Warranty\n- This code is provided as is. The developer does not assume any liability for issues caused by the use of this integration.\n- Use at your own risk.\n\n### Configuration Options\n- **IP Address**: The IP address of the Victron GX device running the ModbusTCP service. It's only configurable during setup and it's recommended to make the GX device static in your router.\n- **Port**: The port on which Victron exposes the ModbusTCP service. Victron exposes the service on port 502 but this configuration option is present to allow for proxy configuration (via Nginx, etc.). The average user doesn't need to change the port being used.\n- **Interval**: Determines the number of rounded seconds to use between updating the entities provided by this integration. For slower systems, setting the interval to lower than 5 seconds might cause issues. Setting an interval of 0 will result in an interval of 1 second being used.\n- **Write Support**: Ticking the write support option enables an \"advanced\" users mode. If write support is disabled, the integration is \"safer\" to use. Since you can't accidentally change any setting that might cause damage (e.g., to high currents for your cabling). Currently, it is unknown and untested if the ModbusTCP server write registers are guard-railed.\n- **Maximum Currents**: The maximum current in Amps that your system is designed to handle. The maximum current for your battery and battery cabling/busbars.\n- **Voltage Profile**: The voltage profile to use in order to calculate the voltage boundaries (i.e., 4s, 8s, and 16s Lifepo4 configurations).\n- **AC Voltage**: The AC voltage for a single phase in your region (currently supported: US: 120V and EU: 230V). This setting is used in combination with AC current to automatically calculate the max wattage for applicable wattage settings.\n\n### Helpful Resources\nThe following links can be helpful resources:\""

This source code repository contains the Apache-2.0 licensed source-code for the different implementations of OSeMOSYS GNU MathProg, Pyomo, PuLP and GAMS.\n\nFor an in-depth introduction to the underlying model and its structure, you can read the (needs access to Elsevier ScienceDirect).\n\nThe different versions are contained in subfolders, together with readme files which provide information of how to install and run the code.\n\nThe OSeMOSYS code packages you need for writing your own models are released on the , along with a lot of useful information on how to get started.\n\nOSeMOSYS consists of this repository and several submodules, which contain the different language implementations of the OSeMOSYS formulation.\n\nTo obtain all the OSeMOSYS code including the language implementations for development purposes, run the following commands from your command line:\n\nIf successful, this should download all the code to the folder you specified in the first step.\n\nAlternatively, use the `--recurse-submodules` argument to the `git clone` command:\n\nPlease view our separate document to find out how to contribute to the OSeMOSYS community.\n\nOSeMOSYS is a full-fledged systems optimization model generator for long-term energy planning. Unlike long established energy systems models, such as MARKAL/TIMES (ETSAP, 2010), MESSAGE (IAEA, 2010), PRIMES (NTUA, 2010), EFOM (Van der Voort, 1982) and POLES (Enerdata, 2010), OSeMOSYS potentially requires a less significant learning curve and time commitment to build and operate. Additionally, by not using proprietary software or commercial programming languages and solvers, OSeMOSYS requires no upfront financial investment. These two advantages extend the availability of energy modeling to large communities of students, business analysts, government specialists and developing countries energy researchers.\n\nOSeMOSYS is designed to fill a gap in the analytical toolbox available to the energy research community and energy planners in developing countries. At present there exists a useful, but limited set of accessible energy system models. These tools often require significant investment in terms of human resources, training and software purchases in order to apply or further develop them. In addition, their structure is often such that integration with other tools, when possible, can be difficult.\n\nThe OSeMOSYS code is relatively straightforward and transparent and allows for simple refinements and the ability to conduct sophisticated analyses. As models are made to generate insights, OSeMOSYS allows a test-bed for new energy model developments.\n\nEnabling graduate students to build and iteratively develop formal energy models will impart this knowledge base to very wide range of energy market roles and positions. Extending the human capacity of private and public policy makers to use and understand energy models is a key step in the effective use and interpretation of formal analytical tools. And growing human capacity in energy modeling in developing countries – whose institutions have relatively fewer research resources – is particularly important, given the growth of developing countries in energy related emissions, resource use, and demand for energy services.\n\nOSeMOSYS community welcomes professionals and experts from different levels: decision makers, policy officers, energy planners, developers of new model functionalities, programmers.\n\nOSeMOSYS is part of the OpTIMUS Community, Practice 3: Open Software, together with other world class, peer reviewed open source tools and data.\n\nOpTIMUS aims at promoting quantitative analysis to inform sustainable development policy, through the coordination of networks to advance open source software, knowledge development and capacity building. It is organized in three practices - modeling and capacity building for policy support, expert review and quality control, and software development.

Build your smart energy apps & services with FlexMeasures as backend for real-time orchestration!\n\nIn a nutshell, FlexMeasures turns data into optimized schedules for flexible assets like batteries and heat pumps, or for flexible industry processes:\n\nHere is why using FlexMeasures is a great idea:\n\nDeveloping energy flexibility apps & services (e.g. to enable demand response) is crucial, but expensive. FlexMeasures reduces development costs with real-time data intelligence & integrations, uncertainty models and developer support such as API/UI and plugins.\n\nSo why optimise the schedules of flexible assets? Because planning ahead allows flexible assets to serve the whole system with their flexibility, e.g. by shifting energy consumption to other times. For the asset owners, this creates CO₂ savings but also monetary value (e.g. through self-consumption, dynamic tariffs and grid incentives). FlexMeasures thrives to be applicable in cases with multiple sources of value (\"value stacking\") and multiple types of assets (e.g. home/office/factory).\n\nAs possible users, we see energy service companies (ESCOs) who want to build real-time apps & services around energy flexibility for their customers, or medium/large industrials who are looking for support in their internal digital tooling. However, even small companies and hobby projects might find FlexMeasures useful!\n\nFlexMeasures is designed to help with three basic needs of developers in the energy flexibility domain:\n\nFlexMeasures is designed to make decisions based on data in an automated way. Data pipelining and dedicated machine learning tooling is crucial.\n\nAPI/CLI functionality to read in time series data\nExtensions for integrating 3rd party data, e.g. from  or \nForecasting for the upcoming hours\nSchedule optimization for flexible assets\n\nMuch developer time is spent correcting data and treating it correctly, so that you know you are computing on the right knowledge. FlexMeasures is built on the , so we model this real-world aspect accurately:\n\nExpected data properties are explicit (e.g. unit, time resolution)\nIncoming data is converted to fitting unit and time resolution automatically\nFlexMeasures also stores who thought that something happened (or that it will happen), and when they thought so\nUncertainty can be modelled (useful for forecasting)\n\nBuilding customer-facing apps & services is where developers make impact. We make their work easy. FlexMeasures has well-documented API endpoints and CLI commands to interact with its model and data. You can extend it easily with your own logic by writing plugins. A backend UI shows you your assets in maps and your data in plots. There is also support for plots to be available per API, for integration in your own frontend. Multi-tenancy ― model multiple accounts on one server. Data is only seen/editable by authorized users in the right account.\n\nHead over to our , e.g. the  or the . Or find more information on .\n\nSee also , e.g. for FlexMeasures plugin examples.\n\nFlexMeasures was initiated by  in The Netherlands in order to make sure that smart backend software is available to all parties working with energy flexibility, no matter where they are working on their local energy transition. We made FlexMeasures freely available under the Apache2.0 licence and it is now . Within the FlexMeasures project, .

The model is being developed as a framework for a series of research studies and demonstration projects in sustainable transportation at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with collaborators from other Department of Energy national labs, the private sector, and the public sector.\n\nBEAM is built around the MATSim—an open-source framework for implementing large-scale agent-based transport simulations—with extensive modifications to allow for multithreaded within-day simulation of interacting agents. Many of BEAM's inputs, including the road network, transit system, synthetic population, and input agent plans, can be exported from existing MATSim models and read directly into BEAM, or they can be provided in simpler and more flexible formats. BEAM’s within-day AgentSim simulation includes features such as on-demand mobility, mode choice, parking selection, and discretionary trip planning. BEAM also adapts MATSim’s traffic network simulation and between-iteration replanning capabilities to allow it to approximate dynamic user equilibrium across all of the choice dimensions offered its agents.\n\nBEAM has always been designed as open-source software intended to benefit from an evolving ecosystem of related models and products in the transportation and energy domain. These include activity-based travel demand models, which allow for a more sophisticated treatment of agents’ pre-day travel planning, vehicle energy consumption models, metrics for summarizing a transport system’s accessibility and efficiency, and integration with power grid models. While BEAM is designed to flexibly and efficiently link with other models of transportation system components, it also allows for an implementation to be built from scratch while relying only on free and publicly available data processed through several widely-used and opensource tools.\n\nThe BEAM team maintains both a and\n\nTry running BEAM with our simple\nCheck out the for more detailed\ninformation on using or contributing to the BEAM project\n\nPlease visit the\nUsers are welcome to submit\nand\nThe group is a helpful platform for contacting\nBEAM users and developers with questions and requests\n\nA detailed description of BEAM's component algorithms and software, along with descriptions of a New York City case study, have been \""

It allows users to project the ecoinvent 3 database into the future, using scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). It does so by modifying the ecoinvent database to reflect projected energy policy trajectories, include emerging technologies, modify market shares as well as technologies' efficiency.\n\nAmong others, it can be used to assess the environmental impacts of future energy systems, and to compare different energy policies. It includes a set of IAM scenarios and a set of tools to create custom scenarios.\n\nThe tool was designed to be user-friendly and to allow for reproducible results. While it is built on the , its outputs can naturally be used in , but also in other LCA software, such as SimaPro, OpenLCA, or directly in Python.\n\nThe tool is described in the following scientific publication: . If this tool helps you in your research, please consider citing this publication.\n\nAlso, use the following references to cite the scenarios used with the tool:\n\nREMIND scenarios: Baumstark et al.

It is designed to analyze long-term energy transition pathways, accounting for technological, economic, and environmental factors. REMIND simulates how regions invest in different technologies and energy resources to balance economic growth and climate targets, while considering factors like energy efficiency, emissions, and resource availability. The model is particularly strong in its detailed representation of energy markets and macroeconomic interactions across regions, making it valuable for global climate policy assessments. |\n| IMAGE    | IMAGE (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment) is a comprehensive IAM developed to explore the interactions between human development, energy consumption, and environmental systems over the long term. It focuses on assessing how land use, food systems, energy systems, and climate change interact under different policy scenarios. The model integrates biophysical processes, such as land-use change and greenhouse gas emissions, with socio-economic drivers like population growth and economic development. IMAGE is commonly used for analyzing sustainable development strategies, climate impacts, biodiversity loss, and exploring mitigation and adaptation options. |\n| TIAM-UCL | TIAM-UCL (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model by University College London) is a global energy system model based on the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) framework, developed to evaluate long-term decarbonization pathways for global energy systems. It provides detailed insights into energy technology options, resource availability, and emission reduction strategies under various climate policy scenarios. The model focuses on the trade-offs and synergies between energy security, economic costs, and environmental outcomes. TIAM-UCL is frequently used to analyze scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement and examine technological innovation's role in mitigating climate change globally. |\n\n\nWhat's new in 2.2.0?\n====================\n\n`IncrementalDatabase`: allows distinguishing the contribution of each sector to the total impact.\n\nWhat's new in 2.1.4?\n====================\n\nIntegration of TIAM-UCL scenarios\n\n\nWhat's new in 2.1.1?\n====================\n\nEcoinvent 3.10 support\nAdds inventories on ammonia production\nFixes issues with scaling applied to PV systems\n\nWhat's new in 2.1.0?\n====================\n\nMore efficient use of memory.\nEasier syntax for using custom scenarios.\n\nWhat's new in 2.0.0?\n====================\n\nAdds .write_db_to_olca(), which produces a slightly modified version of a Simapro CSV database file which can then be imported in OpenLCA.

It is developed as part of the Open Energy Platform. The OEO is published on GitHub under an open source license. The language used is the Manchester OWL Syntax, which was chosen because it is user-friendly for editing and viewing differences of edited files. The OEO is constantly being extended. The first version of the OEO has been released on June 11th, 2019. A Steering Committee (OEO-SC) was created to accompany the development, increase awareness of the ontology and include it in current projects.\n\nThis domain ontology is a collaborative effort to represent the context of energy system analysis based on standard terminologies used by human experts in this field of research. It is designed to improve transparency and facilitate comparability and transferability of energy system modelling and scenario analysis. This ontology makes use of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and its principles. It re-uses several other ontologies as described in the README.\n\nThis repository is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. For a scientific citation please see the README. To cite a specific class of the ontology and its definition please use the following convention:\n'class label' (FUll-URI) from the README\n\nExample:\n'energy system' (https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00030024) from the README\n\nThe latest version of the OEO can be accessed on the GitHub repository and the documentation. All released versions can be downloaded directly from the GitHub repository. The currently developed version is available on the default branch.\n\nThe source code of the ontology is found in the folder src/ontology/ The main file is src/ontology/oeo.omn All own modules are collected in the folder src/ontology/edits/ The following diagram illustrates the modular file structure of the OEO. It depicts the import and file hierarchy from external imports (right) to the main file oeo.omn (left).\n\nThe imported modules are under src/ontology/imports/ To get an overview of the existing modules, take a look at the following wiki article: We recommend to use the software Protégé to open and edit the ontology. Additionally, an ontology viewer is available on the Open Energy Platform.\n\nThis is an interdisciplinary open source project, help is always welcome. Everyone with good intentions is invited to develop this repository.\n\nThe development of the ontology happens mainly on GitHub and is supplemented by regular (online) meetings to review the progress and discuss more complicated topics. If you would like to participate in meetings you can become a team member. Use the GitHub repository and pull requests after approval.\n\nIf you're new to GitHub or ontologies check out our README article for some first advice and helpful links. You may also use the README to get used to the necessary tools and background information. The workflow is described in the README file. Please check it out before you start working on this project. Points that are not clear in the file can be discussed in a README. Please read the README for more information about the ontology, its standards, its best practice principles and the BFO classification.\n\nWiki articles that you would be most helpflul to a beginner are including subsections including subsections as well as the README\n\nExperts in ontology engineering, economy and energy-system modelling work together collaboratively. We combine domain knowledge with knowledge about how an ontology should be designed. If you have a specific question about ontology design, energy system modelling or economy (in context of this ontology), you can contact one of these teams (or persons) to notify its members that you need their feedback or help.\n\nThe OEO is organised in a general team and several tasks:\n\nAll developers of the OEO\n\nGeneral team\nContact point for personal and team related concerns\nStrategic and long-term development and coordination of developers\nMembers of the OEO-SC\nCoordinates the periodic releases\n\nKnowledge related to energy system modelling and simulation\nKnowledge related to economic system, costs, monetary issues\nKnowledge related to linked open data\nKnowledge related to meteorology and weather\n\nKnowledge related to formal ontology expertise and BFO\""

Rays are followed through a 3D scene and their interactions with objects are recorded to build up statistical information about energy flow.\n\nThis is useful in photovoltaics and non-imaging optics where the goal is to design systems which efficiently transport light to target locations. \n\nOne of its key features is the ability to simulate re-absorption in luminescent materials. For example, like in devices like Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs).\n\nA basic LSC can be simulated and visualised in five lines of code,\n\nThis script will render the ray-tracing in real time,\n\npvtrace has been validate against three other luminescent concentrator codes. For full details see  notebook\n\nOn MacOS pvtrace can be installed easily using , the pip command and . First install , then install spatialindex for the RTree dependency,\n\nbrew install spatialindex\n\nNext, create a clean virtual environment for pvtrace\n\npyenv install 3.7.8\npyenv virtualenv 3.7.8 pvtrace-env\npyenv activate pvtrace-env\npip install pvtrace\n\nOn Linux and Windows you must use conda to create the python environment. Optionally you can also use this method on MacOS too if you prefer conda over pyenv.\n\nconda create --name pvtrace-env python=3.7.8\nconda activate pvtrace-env\nconda install Rtree\npip install pvtrace\n\nDownload the example script either manually or using curl,\n\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljfarrell/pvtrace/master/examples/hello_world.py > hello_world.py\n\nNow active your python environment! \n\nIf you installed using pyenvdo the following,\n\npyenv local pvtrace-env\n\nIf you are using conda to this,\n\nconda activate pvtrace-env\n\nNow start the meshcat server with the command,\n\nmeshcat-server\n\nThis will print information like,\n\nzmq_url=tcp://127.0.0.1:6000\nweb_url=http://127.0.0.1:7000/static/\n\nOpen a new terminal window and again activate your pvtrace-env.\n\nOpen hello_world.py and make sure the line below has zmq_url of your meshcat-server,\n\nrenderer = MeshcatRenderer(\nzmq_url=\"tcp://127.0.0.1:6000\", wireframe=True, open_browser=True\n)   \n\nYou can now run pvtrace scripts!

This is physically accurate, down to treating individual absorption and emission events, but is slow because the problem cannot be vectorised as each ray is followed individually.\n\nInteractive Jupyter notebooks are in , download and take a look, although they can be viewed online.\n\nPlease use the github tracker for bug fixes, suggestions, or support questions.\n\nIf you are considering contributing to pvtrace, first fork the project. This will make it easier to include your contributions using pull requests.\n\nFirst create a new development environment using or , but do not install pvtrace using pip! You will need to clone your own copy of the source code in the following steps.\nUse the GitHub fork button to make your own fork of the project. This will make it easy to include your changes in pvtrace using a pull request.\nFollow the steps below to clone and install the development dependencies\n\nYou should now be able to edit the source code and simply run scripts directly without the need to reinstall anything.\n\nPlease add or modify an existing unit tests in the pvtrace/tests directory if you are adding new code. This will make it much easier to include your changes in the project.\n\nPull requests will be considered. Please make contact before doing a lot of work, to make sure that the changes will definitely be included in the main project.\n\nYou can get in contact with me directly at dan@excitonlabs.com or raise an issue on the issue tracker.\n\nBasic environment requires the following packages which will be installed with pip automatically\n\npython >= 3.7.2\nnumpy\npandas\ntrimesh[easy]\nmeshcat >= 0.0.16\nanytree\""

I also noticed that it is available under the name Minger HRequires Python Tested under Python 3.7 on Linux. Should also work for Windows.\n\nThe wrapper uses  to interface with Bluetooth and requires root permissions.\n\nSee `__main__.py` for a full example in action.\n\nWhile the wrapper has not been tested on Windows, you should be able to use it by replacing the backend `pygatt` uses internally.\n\nMajor help in reverse engineering both Govee's app and the Bluetooth protocol.\n\nThe reverse engineering was done by analyzing the Bluetooth Low Energy communication between  and the LED.\n\nAndroid has a developer feature that enables you to log and export Bluetooth traffic. Retrieving the dump is a bit different for Samsung phones, see this . You can then pull the log with the . This script pulls the latest log, in the case of Samsung phones.\n\nTo analyze the traffic,  was used. The following filter was helpful in understanding the protocol:\n\nI noticed a lot of request-ack messages with handles `0x15 <--> 0x11` respectively. Hexcodes for RGB values recognizable, so I filtered those out.\nOpcode `0x52` filters for write commands as we are only interested in the traffic we send.\nThere were two types of prefixes in these packets: `0xaa` and `0x33`, where `0x33` carried the RGB data.\n\nI exported the dump as its own PCAP file and reopened it in Wireshark to export it as JSON. In order to make it easier to analyze the packets' payloads, I put every packet's payload in a row of a text file.\n\nFor this scenario\n1) the LED is turned on, then off, then on again\n2) the color is changed\n3) the brightness is changed\n4) the warm/cold-white slider in the app is used\n5) the LED is turned off again\n\nThis was mostly done with a delay of approx. 5 seconds in between to recognize the timestamps in Wireshark.\n\nSample snooped traffic:\n\nSpaces were added according to how I understood the boundaries of the protocol.\n`0x33` seems to be a command indicator (the only alternative value for the first byte is `0xaa`)\nThe second byte seems identify the packet type\n  `0x01`: power\n  `0x04`: brightness\n  `0x05`: color\nThe third byte differs based on type.\n  For power packets, it's a boolean indicating the power state.\n  For brightness packets, it corresponds to a `uint8` brightness value.\n  For color packets, this indicates an operation mode. The app offers a microphone, a scenes and a manual mode (labeled \"color\" in the app). We are only interested in manual mode, which is `0x02`.\nColor packets now carry an RGB value, followed by a boolean and a second RGB value. The boolean seems to switch the set of LEDs used within the bulb. There is one set for RGB values and one for warm/cold-white values, where `True` corresponds to the warm/cold-white LEDs. When the flag is set, the first RGB value seems to be ignored and vice-versa. The values for warm/cold-white LEDs cannot be set arbitrarily. The slider within the app UI uses a list of hardcoded color codes. (thanks Henje!)\nZeropadding follows.\nFinally, a checksum over the payload is calculated by XORing all bytes.\""

I want to run the dishwasher before 0800 each night.\nAn entity named octopusagile.dishwasher is created in Home assistant.\n\nCreate a sensor for each of: current rate, previous rate and next rate\n\nAll future rates stored in entity attributes\n\nThe average rate from the day update_timers runs at 23:00 to 22:30 the next day, excluding the 16:00 to 18:30 time periods where the peak rate is applied.\n\nThe average rate from the day update_timers runs at 23:00 to 22:30 the next day, including the peak.\n\nAll timers as created by the timer configuration listed in entity attribute\n\nRegion code as set in configuration\n\nWhen the half hour timer will next run\n\nWhen the half hour timer last run\n\nWhen the update timers timer will next run\n\nWhen the update timers timer last run\n\nA seperate entity for each configured run_device with the time stored in state and start time, start in, end in and average rate stored in the attributes\n\nNote that i am using an owl energy monitor for the energy usage stats. I will look at pulling these stats direct from octopus once my agile account is setup\n\nThis repo uses `pipenv` to manage Python versions and dependencies.

The dataset includes two general electrochemical analysis methods: Polarization and Impedance curves. The dataset considers the effects of different pressures of H2/O2 gas, different voltages, and various humidity conditions in several steps. The behavior of PEM fuel cells during distinct operation condition tests, activation procedures, and different operation conditions before and after activation can be analyzed from the data.\n\nIn Polarization curves, voltage and power density change as a function of H2/O2 flow and relative humidity. The resistance of the used equivalent circuit of the fuel cell can be calculated from Impedance data. Therefore, the experimental response of the cell is evident in the presented data, which is useful for depth analysis, simulation, and material performance investigation in PEM fuel cell researches.

I used `virtualenv` to manage environments, and I created my environment like this:\n\n```\nvirtualenv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nYou may also be able to use your system Python with pip, or this will probably work with other version management system as well.\n\nNext, extract labels from the block metadata with `python label_blocks.py`. This step uses the `extraData` and the `miner` fields to make a guess about what region a block was mined in.\n\nThen estimate emissions factors with `python estimate_emissions_factors.py`. This step maps each region to a distribution of electric grids, and takes a weighted average of the emissions factor for each grid.\n\nFinally, estimate daily power and daily emissions with `python estimate_power_emissions.py`. This step uses the hashrate and hardware efficiency data to estimate the average daily power, and applies the emissions factors to estimate the daily emissions.\n\nIf you want to run this code with the latest data, or you want to generate the block metadata index manually instead of starting from the snapshot, you will need direct access to an Ethereum node. As of 2021-11-20 running an Ethereum node requires 690GB of storage, and it can take 3-4 days to sync the entire chain even on a very fast network. This can be done by installing `geth` and running it in the background. Then run `python block_updater.py` to extract the metadata from all blocks. This will take a few hours.\n\nTo run all these scripts in one go, starting with the `block_update.py`, run `bash update.sh`.\n\nTo update the data and figures in the article, first run all the above scripts. Then run `bash update-article.sh`. This will run some scripts that save the updated figures in `article/images`, and it will save some numbers for the article in `output/results.txt`. Check the results in `output/results.txt` manually, then paste them into the appropriate section in `article/data.dat`.\""

It monitors the energy consumed by specific device of the host machine such as :\n\nintel CPU socket package\nRAM (for intel server architectures)\nintel integrated GPU (for client architectures)\nnvidia GPU\n\npyJoules uses the Intel \"_Running Average Power Limit_\" (RAPL) technology that estimates power consumption of the CPU, ram and integrated GPU. This technology is available on Intel CPU since the (2010).\n\npyJoules uses the nvidia \"_Nvidia Management Library_\" technology to measure energy consumption of nvidia devices. The energy measurement API is only available on nvidia GPU with )(2018)\n\nOnly GNU/Linux support is available for the moment. We are working on Mac support\n\nRAPL energy counters overflow after several minutes or hours, potentially causing false-negative energy readings.\n\npyJoules takes this into account and adds the counter's maximum possible value, `max_energy_range_uj`, to negative energy measurements. However, if a counter overflows twice during a single energy measurement, the reported energy will be `max_energy_range_uj` less than the expected value.\n\nPyJoule use hardware measurement tools (intel RAPL, nvidia GPU tools, ...) to measure device energy consumption. Theses tools have a mesasurement frequency that depend of the device. Thus, you can't use Pyjoule to measure energy consumption during a period shorter than the device energy measurement frequency. Pyjoule will return null values if the measurement period is to short.\n\npython >= 3.7\n(if you want nvidia GPU support)\n\nYou can install pyJoules with pip: `pip install pyJoules`\n\nif you want to use pyJoule to also measure nvidia GPU energy consumption, you have to install it with nvidia driver support using this command : `pip install pyJoules[nvidia]`.\n\nThis Readme describe basic usage of pyJoules. For more in depth description, read the documentation \n\nHere are some basic usages of pyJoules. Please note that the reported energy consumption is not only the energy consumption of the code you are running. This includes the _global energy consumption_ of all the process running on the machine during this period, thus including the operating system and other applications. That is why we recommend to eliminate any extra programs that may alter the energy consumption of the machine hosting experiments and to keep _only_ the code under measurement (_i.e._, no extra applications, such as graphical interface, background running task...). This will give the closest measure to the real energy consumption of the measured code.\n\nTo measure the energy consumed by the machine during the execution of the function `foo()` run the following code:\n\nThis will print on the console the recorded energy consumption of all the monitorable devices during the execution of function `foo`.\n\ndecorator basic usage will print iformation with this format :\n\nbegin timestamp : XXX; tag : YYY; duration : ZZZ;device_name: AAAA\n\nwith :\nbegin timestamp : monitored function launching time\ntag: tag of the measure, if nothing is specified, this will be the function name\nduration: function execution duration\ndevice_name: power consumption of the device `device_name` in uJ\n\nfor cpu and ram devices, device_name match the RAPL domain described on the image below plus the CPU socket id. Rapl domain are described \n\n\n\nYou can easily configure which device to monitor using the parameters of the `measureit` decorator. \nFor example, the following example only monitors the CPU power consumption on the CPU socket `1` and the Nvidia GPU `0`.\nBy default, pyJoules monitors all the available devices of the CPU sockets.\n\nYou can append the following domain list to monitor them : \n\npyJoules.device.rapl_device.RaplPackageDomain : CPU (specify the socket id in parameter)\npyJoules.device.rapl_device.RaplDramDomain : RAM (specify the socket id in parameter)\npyJoules.device.rapl_device.RaplUncoreDomain : integrated GPU (specify the socket id in parameter)\npyJoules.device.rapl_device.RaplCoreDomain : RAPL Core domain (specify the socket id in parameter)\npyJoules.device.nvidia_device.NvidiaGPUDomain : Nvidia GPU (specify the socket id in parameter)\n\nto understand which par of the cpu each RAPL domain monitor, see this \n\nIf you want to handle data with different output than the standard one, you can configure the decorator with an `EnergyHandler` instance from the `pyJoules.handler` module.\n\nAs an example, if you want to write the recorded energy consumption in a .csv file:\n\nThis will produce a csv file of 100 lines. Each line containing the energy consumption recorded during one execution of the function `foo`.\nOther predefined `Handler` classes exist to export data to *MongoDBand *Pandadataframe.\n\nIf you want to know where is the \"_hot spots_\" where your python code consume the most energy you can add \"_breakpoints_\" during the measurement process and tag them to know amount of energy consumed between this breakpoints.\n\nFor this, you have to use a context manager to measure the energy consumption. It is configurable as the decorator. For example, here we use an `EnergyContext` to measure the power consumption of CPU `1` and nvidia gpu `0` and report it in a csv file :\n\nThis will record the energy consumed :\n\nbetween the beginning of the `EnergyContext` and the call of the `ctx.record` method\nbetween the call of the `ctx.record` method and the end of the `EnergyContext`\n\nEach measured part will be written in the csv file. One line per part.\n\nRAPL domains match part of the cpu socket as described in this image : \n\nPackage : correspond to the wall cpu energy consumption\ncore : correpond to the sum of all cpu core energy consumption\nuncore : correspond to the integrated GPU\n\npyJoules is an open-source project developed by the (University of Lille and Inria) that is part of the  initiative.\n\nThe documentation is available .\n\nYou can follow the latest news and asks questions by subscribing to our <a href=\"mailto:sympa@inria.fr?subject=subscribe powerapi\">mailing list</a>.\n\nIf you would like to contribute code, you can do so via GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.\n\nWhen submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing coding conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.\""

However, the model is generated and trained on a specific revision (listed between brackets), and the accuracy is best on this particular revision.\n\nWe currently support the following Raspberry Pi and Asus Tinker Board models:\nModel Zero W (rev 1.1), for 32 bits OS\nModel 1 B (rev 2), for 32 bits OS\nModel 1 B(rev 1.2), for 32 bits OS\nModel 2 B (rev 1.1), for 32 bits OS\nModel 3 B (rev 1.2), for 32 bits OS\nModel 3 B(rev 1.3), for 32 bits OS\nModel 4 B (rev 1.1, and rev 1.2), for both 32 bits and 64 bits OS\nModel 400 (rev 1.0), for 64 bits OS\nModel 5 B (rev 1.0), for 64 bits OS\nAsus Tinker Board (S)\n\nPowerJoular is written in Ada and can be easily compiled, and its unique binary added to your system PATH.\n\nEasy-to-use installation scripts are available in the  folder.\nJust open the installer folder and run the appropriate file to build and/or install or uninstall the program and systemd service.\n\nwill build (using ) and install the program binary to  and systemd service. It requires having installed GNAT and gprbuild (see ).\ndeletes the program binary and systemd service.\n\nTo use PowerJoular, just run the command .\nOn PC/servers, PowerJoular uses Intel's RAPL through the Linux powercap sysfs, and therefore requires root/sudo access on the latest Linux kernels (5.10 and newer): .\n\nBy default, the software will show the power consumption of the CPU and its utilization.\nThe difference (increase or decrease) of power consumption from last metric will also be shown.\n\nThe following options are available:\nshow the help message\nshow version number\nspecifiy a particular PID to monitor\nspecifiy a particular application name to monitor (will monitor all PIDs of the application)\nsave monitoring data to the given filename path\nsave only last monitoring data to the given filename path (file overwritten with only latest power measures)\nprint energy data to the terminal\nprint debug info to the terminal\nuse linear regression models (less accurate than the default polynomial models) for Raspberry Pi energy models\nspecify a filename for the power consumption of the virtual machine\nspecify the format of the VM power, either  format (generated with the  option: 3 columns csv file with the 3rd containing the power consumption the VM), or  format (1 column containing just the power consumption of the VM)\n\nYou can mix options, i.e.,  will monitor PID 144 and will print to the terminal.\n\nPowerJoular is written with Ada, and requires a modern Ada compiler, such as GNAT.\n\nPowerJoular depends on the following commands and libraries for certain of its functions, but can function without them:\nnvidia-smi: for monitoring power consumption of Nvidia graphic cards\nLinux powercap with Intel RAPL support: for monitoring power consumption of Intel processors and SoC\n\nOn a modern GNU/Linux distribution, just install the GNAT compiler (and GPRBuild), usually available from the distribution's repositories:\n\nFor other distributions, use their package manager to download the compiler, or check , including RHEL and its clones which does not ship with Ada support in GCC.\n\nTo compile the project, just type  if using the latest GPRBuild versions.\n\nOr, on older versions, create the  folder first, then type .\n\nThe PowerJoular binary will be created in the  folder.\n\nBy default, the project will statically link the required libraries, and therefore the PowerJoular binary can be copied to any compatible system and used as-is.\n\nTo build with dynamic linking, remove or comment the static switch in the  file, in particular these lines:\n\nYou can also compile PowerJoular with the GNAT compiler only (without the need for GPRBuild).\n\nJust compile using gnatmake. For example, to compile from  folder (so .o and .ali files are generated there), type the following:\n\nIf you have  installed, you can use it to build PowerJoular with:\n\nThe  script cross-compiles PowerJoular to multiple platforms (for now x86_64 and aarch64, but can be tweaked to add other platforms).\nThe script then generates RPM and DEB binary installation packages for these platforms.\n\nThe script needs a x86_64 and an aarch64 gnat compiler, along with deb and rpm packaging tools.\n\nInstall them according to your distribution. For example, in Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 :\n\nA systemd service is provided and can be installed (by copying  in  folder to ).\nThe service will run the program with the  option (which only saves the latest power data) and saves data to .\nThe service can be enabled to run automatically on boot.\n\nThe systemd service is automatically installed when installing PowerJoular using the GNU/Linux provided packages.\n\nTo cite our work in a research paper, please cite our paper in the 18th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE2022).\n\nPowerJoular and JoularJX: Multi-Platform Software Power Monitoring Tools.

Are you tired of implementing your own techniques? If yes, Learnergy is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of energy-based machine learning algorithms. From datasets to fully-customizable models, from internal functions to external communications, we will foster all research related to energy-based machine learning.\n\nUse Learnergy if you need a library or wish to:\n\nCreate your energy-based machine learning algorithm;\nDesign or use pre-loaded learners;\nMix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem;\nBecause it is incredible to learn things.\n\nRead the docs at .\n\nLearnergy is compatible with: Python 3.6+.\n\nThe very first information you need is in the very next section.\nInstalling is also easy if you wish to read the code and bump yourself into, follow along.\nNote that there might be some additional steps in order to use our solutions.\nIf there is a problem, please do not hesitate, call us.\n\nIf you use Learnergy to fulfill any of your needs, please cite us:\n\nFirst of all. We have examples. Yes, they are commented. Just browse to `examples/`, choose your subpackage, and follow the example. We have high-level examples for most of the tasks we could think.\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to learn even more, please take a minute:\n\nLearnergy is based on the following structure, and you should pay attention to its tree:\n\nCore is the core. Essentially, it is the parent of everything. You should find parent classes defining the basis of our structure. They should provide variables and methods that will help to construct other modules.\n\nJust because we are computing stuff, it does not means that we do not need math. Math is the mathematical package, containing low-level math implementations. From random numbers to distributions generation, you can find your needs on this module.\n\nThis is the heart. All models are declared and implemented here. We will offer you the most fantastic implementation of everything we are working with. Please take a closer look into this package.\n\nThis is a utility package. Common things shared across the application should be implemented here. It is better to implement once and use as you wish than re-implementing the same thing over and over again.\n\nEveryone needs images and plots to help visualize what is happening, correct? This package will provide every visual-related method for you. Check a specific image, your fitness function convergence, plot reconstructions, weights, and much more.\n\nWe believe that everything has to be easy. Not tricky or daunting, Learnergy will be the one-to-go package that you will need, from the very first installation to the daily-tasks implementing needs. If you may just run the following under your most preferred Python environment (raw, conda, virtualenv, whatever):\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to install the bleeding-edge version, please clone this repository and use:\n\nNote that sometimes, there is a need for additional implementation. If needed, from here, you will be the one to know all of its details.\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\nNo specific additional commands needed.\n\nWe know that we do our best, but it is inevitable to acknowledge that we make mistakes. If you ever need to report a bug, report a problem, talk to us, please do so! We will be available at our bests at this repository or mateus.roder@unesp.br and gustavo.rosa@unesp.br.\""

This work has been carried out on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe aim of this web app is to present precise carbon inventories per passenger for each mode of transport and each journey. These results enable users to make informed choices in the context of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. To put these results into context, total net yearly per-capita emissions should not exceed 2 tons CO2eq in 2050 to limit global warming below +2°C.\n\nYou can have a look at https://lowtrip.fr/.\n\nTo calculate CO2 equivalent emissions per person, we multiply the distance of a journey (km) by the corresponding emission factor (mass of CO2 equivalent per person per km) of a mean of transport. For a multistep journey, these emissions are summed over the different steps:\n\n$$CO_2eq = \\sum_{step} Distance(km) \\times Emission \\\\: Factor(kgCO_2eq / km) $$\n\n| Mean of Transport | Distance |\n| --| --|\n| Train | OpenStreetMap network |\n| Car & Bus & eCar | OpenStreetMap network |\n| Bike route | OpenStreetMap network |\n| Plane | Geodesic distance and average detour |\n| Ferry & Sailboat | Approximation of shortest path |\n\n| Mean of Transport | Variable |\n| --| --|\n| Train | Visited countries |\n| Bus | |\n| Car | Number of passengers |\n| Electric car | Visited countries & Number of passengers |\n| Bike route | |\n| Plane | Distance of journey |\n| Ferry | User-specified parameters |\n| Sailboat | ; improvements on the way |\n\nEmissions factors consider usage (linked to the manufacture and use of energy to move the vehicle) as well as infrastructure and vehicle construction where these are significant. The table below summarizes the types of emissions taken into account by lowtrip. Empty cells mean that the related emissions did not contribute significantly to the result and are therefore excluded to facilitate understanding and readability for the user.\n\n| Mean of Transport | Usage | Vehicle construction | Infrastruture construction |\n| --|  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |\n| Train | :white_check_mark: |  | :white_check_mark: |\n| Car & Bus & eCar | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |  |\n| Bike route | | :white_check_mark: | Not found |\n| Plane |  :white_check_mark: |  |  |\n| Ferry |  :white_check_mark: | | Not found |\n| Sailboat | :white_check_mark: | | Not found |\n\nAll assumptions, data and sources used are available in the document.\n\nHave docker installed\n\nAt the root of the directory, run:\n\nYou can now connect to to test the application.\n\nNote: If you want to launch them in the backgroup and leave them running, you can add the flag -d or --detach.\n\nAt the root of the directory, run:\n\nAt the root of the directory, run:\n\nHave python & node installed\n\nYou can format the code with ruff:\n\n*Bonnemaizon, Xavier, Ni, Clara, Gres, Paola & Pellas, Chiara. lowtrip (2024). https://lowtrip.fr\""

You need to register but allows to ask quick questions and hopefullly get quick answers.\n(support section) can be used when you don't know how to get something done or you don't quite know why something isn't working. It's highly appreciated if other users can contribute by helping each other (developers are short on time).\nshould be used only when there is a missing feature or something should work but it's not working. Update your tools and test with latest software before submitting an issue. In case of new feature, make sure there is no existing issue. Issues reporting bugs should provide sufficient information to enable locating and fixing the bug.\n\n\n\nWe highly recommend you to go through the getting started chapter of the documentation.\n\nThe chapter explains in great detail the different ways to  SpineOpt. The prerequisites are also mentioned here.\n\nThe chapter also explains how to set up a minimal  to test your installation. This part also includes some explanations on what you see during the setup so you can already get a bit familiar with using SpineOpt.\n\nIf any issues arise during the first two steps, you can consult the  section.\n\nOnce you have succesfully installed and verified the correct functioning of SpineOpt, you can start learning how to use SpineOpt. To that end you can visit the tutorials chapter of the documentation. The tutorials cover the different features of SpineOpt (the underlying files of the tutorials are part of our tests so these should always be up to date, though the text/images may lag behind some times).\n\n\n\nFor contributing and instructions on reporting issues, see \n\n\n\nSpineOpt is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0 or later.\n\n\n\nPlease cite  when referring to SpineOpt in scientific writing.\n\n`Ihlemann, M., Kouveliotis-Lysikatos, I., Huang, J., Dillon, J., O'Dwyer, C., Rasku, T., Marin, M., Poncelet, K., & Kiviluoma, J.

It intends to advance the state-of-the-art of the simulation tools available for the design and analysis of solar concentrating systems, and to make those tools freely available to anyone interested in using and improving them.\r\n\r\nSome of the most relevant design goals of Tonatiuh are:\r\n  To develop a robust theoretical foundation that will facilitate the optical simulation of almost any type of solar concentrating systems.\r\n  To exhibit a clean and flexible software architecture, that will allow the user to adapt, expand, increase, and modify its functionalities with ease.\r\n  To achieve operating system independence at source level, and run on all major platforms with none, or minor, modifications to its source code.\r\n  To provide the users with an advanced and easy-of-use Graphic User Interface (GUI).\r\n\r\nAdditional information on the rationale for this open source project, and on the goals, general characteristics, and current status of Tonatiuh is given in the two following videos. The first video is based on a  given by Dr. Manuel J. Blanco at the University of Seville in September Although, the audio track is in Spanish, the video is closed-captioned in Spanih, and subtitled in English. Information on how to use the close-caption/subtitle features of YouTube videos can be found . The second video is based on an oral presentation of the paper entitled \"Preliminary validation of Tonatiuh\" given by Dr. Manuel J. Blanco on September 17th, at the 2009 International Energy Agency's SolarPACES Symposium, celebrated in Berlin, Germany.\r\n\r\nThe use of extended Open Inventor files to represent the \"scene\" (i.e. the solar concentrating system, the sunlight model, etc.)\r\n\r\nAn advance and easy-to-use GUI providing:\r\n  3D and tree views of the \"scene\" to simulate.\r\n  Handlers and manipulators to modify and query scene objects using 3D views.\r\n  Interface elements to manage the undo and redo of user actions.\r\n  Interface elements to define de type of Monte Carlo ray tracing to execute.\r\n\r\nA pervasive plugin architecture which allos the user to:\r\n  Add new sunlight models.\r\n  Add new geometric surfaces.\r\n  Add new reflective materials.\r\n  (planned) Add new refractive materials.\r\n  (planned) Add new photon map and other results analyzers, and post-processors.\r\n  (planned) Add new spectrum models.\r\n\r\nAs any other ambitious open source program, Tonatiuh uses and leverages on several existing open source libraries, and tools. The principal open source resources used by Tonatiuh are:\r\n  Digia Qt for the Graphic User Interface (GUI).\r\n  Coin3D Toolkit for 3D Graphics Visualization.\r\n  Marble generic geographical map widget and framework.\r\n  CPPUnit for testing the code.\r\n\r\nAll these tools are used for developing Tonatiuh within the Eclipse IDE in a standard development environment used by the entire developing team.\r\n\r\nFrom version 2.0.1 the format of the outputs of simulations has been changed to be more flexible for post-processing. You can find a description of the format .\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most relevant references:\r\n Les, I., Mutuberria, A., Schöttl, P., Nitz, P. (2017).

The data is then published to the Venus OS system (dbus). The main purpose is to act as a Battery Monitor in your GX and supply State of Charge (SoC) and other values to the inverter/charger.\n\nThe first version of this driver was released by  in September In February 2023 I () made my first PR, since Louis did not have time anymore to contribute to this project.\n\nWith the release of `v1.0.0` I became the main developer of this project. From then on, I have been maintaining the project and developing it further. I'm also solving 99% of the issues on GitHub.\n\nA big thanks to  for the initiation of this project.\n\nThis project takes a lot of time and effort to maintain, answering support requests, adding new features and so on. If you are using this driver and you are happy with it, please make a donation to support me and this project.\n\nTo develop this project, install the requirements. This project makes use of velib_python which is pre-installed on Venus-OS Devices under `/opt/victronenergy/dbus-systemcalc-py/ext/velib_python`. To use the python files locally, `git clone` the  project to velib_python and add velib_python to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.\n\nMake sure the GitHub Actions run fine in your repository.

Check also in your repository settings under `Actions` -> `General` -> `Workflow permissions` if `Read and write permissions` are selected. This will check your code for Flake8 and Black Lint errors.  is a short instruction on how to set up Flake8 and Black Lint checks in VS Code. This will save you a lot of time.\n\nSee this checklist, if you want to\n\nEach supported BMS needs to implement the abstract base class `Battery` from `battery.py`.\n`dbus-serialbattery.py` tries to figure out the correct connected BMS by looping through all known implementations of `Battery` and executing its `test_connection()`. If this returns true, `dbus-serialbattery.py` sticks with this battery and then periodically executes `dbushelpert.publish_battery()`. `publish_battery()` executes `Battery.refresh_data()` which updates the fields of Battery. It then publishes those fields to dbus using `dbushelper.publish_dbus()`\nThe Victron Device will be \"controlled\" by the values published on `/Info/` namely:\n  `/Info/MaxChargeCurrent `\n  `/Info/MaxDischargeCurrent`\n  `/Info/MaxChargeVoltage`\n  `/Info/BatteryLowVoltage`\n  `/Info/ChargeRequest` (not implemented in dbus-serialbattery)\n\nFor more details on the Victron dbus interface see \n\nhttps://discord.gg/YXzFB8rSgx\""

Unfortunately, the datasets are proprietary industry data and I do not own the rights to distribute them to the public. Please do not contact me to request the datasets.\n\nMaximising the economic effectiveness of a wind farm is essential in making wind a more economic source of energy. This effectiveness can be increased through the reduction of operation and maintenance costs, which can be achieved through continuously monitoring the condition of wind turbines. An alternative to expensive condition monitoring systems, which can be uneconomical especially for older wind turbines, is to implement classification algorithms on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) signals, which are collected in most wind turbines. Several publications were reviewed, which were all found to use separate algorithms to predict specific faults in advance. In reality, wind turbines tend to have multiple faults which may happen simultaneously and have correlations with one another. This project focusses on developing a methodology to predict multiple wind turbine faults in advance simultaneously by implementing classification algorithms on SCADA signals for a wind farm with 25 turbines rated at 2,500 kW, spanning a period of 30 months. The data, which included measurements of wind speed, active power and pitch angle, was labelled using corresponding downtime data to detect normal behaviour, faults and varying timescales before a fault occurs. Three different classification algorithms, namely decision trees, random forests and k nearest neighbours were tested using imbalanced and balanced training data, initially to optimise a number of hyperparameters. The random forest classifier produced the best results. Upon conducting a more detailed analysis on the performance of specific faults, it was found that the classifier was unable to detect the varying timescales before a fault with accuracy comparable to that of normal or faulty behaviour. This could have been due to the SCADA data, which are used as features, being unsuitable for detecting the faults, and there is potential to improve this by balancing only these classes.\n\n**Keywords:** wind turbine, classification algorithm, SCADA, fault detection, condition monitoring\n\nProcess SCADA and downtime data\nDowntime categories\nMerge SCADA and downtime data\nPower curves for all turbines\n\nUnless otherwise stated:\n\nCode and scripts are licensed under the .\nContent, images, and documentation are licensed under a .\n\nProject badges are generated using and .\""

Currently, the main purpose of GLAES is performing land eligibility (LE) analyses which, in short, are used to determine which areas within a region are deemed 'eligible' for some purpose (such as placing a wind turbine). Although initially intended to operate in the context of distributed renewable energy systems, such as onshore wind and open-field solar parks, the work flow of GLAES is applicable to any context where a constrained indication of land is desired. Except in the context of Europe, GLAES only provides a framework for conducting these types of analyses, and so the underlying data sources which are used will need to be provided. Fortunately, GLAES is built on top of the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and so is capable of incorporating information from any geospatial dataset which GDAL can interpret; including common GIS formats such as .shp and .tif files. In this way, GLAES affords a high degree of flexibility such that very specific considerations, while still maintaining a consistent application method between studies.\n\nStandardized approach to land eligibility analyses\nApplicable in any geographic region and at any resolution\nCan flexibly incorporate most geospatial datasets: including the common .shp and .tif formats\nSimple visualization and storage of results as common image or raster dataset\nSimple integration of results into other analysis (via numpy array)\n\nA number of precomputed (Prior) datasets which constitute the most commonly considered criteria used for LE analyses have been constructed for the European context. These datasets are formatted to be used directly with the GLAES framework and, in doing so, drastically reduce the time requirements, data management, and overall complexity of conducting these analyses. The Priors also have the added benefit of providing a common data source to all LE researchers, which further promotes consistency between independent LE evaluations. Most important, usage of these datasets is just as easy as applying exclusions from other geospatial datasources. Although the Prior datasets are not included when cloning this repository, they can be downloaded from and installed by unzipping (or placing if downloaded one-by-one) the files in the repo directory glaes/data/priors.\n\n--Objective:\n\nDetermine land eligibility for photovoltaic (PV) modules in the Aachen administration region considering that...\nPV modules should not cover agricultural areas (because people need to eat)\nPV modules should not be within 200 meters of a major road way (because they may get dirty)\nPV modules should not be within 1000 meters of a settlement area (because they are too shiny)\n\n<img src=\"images/example_04.png\" alt=\"Final eligibility result\" width=\"700px\">\n\n--The recommended way to install GLAES is to use the conda-package manager.

Given a volumetric mesh as the input, this code output the simulation of dropping the mesh to the ground.\n\n[Paper], [supplementary], [video], and [code] are now available.\n\nThe result sequence will be output to `build/output` by default.\n\nPlease check the code in `main.cpp` and `parameters.h` for more configuration.\n\nIsotropic As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) energy has been popular for shape editing, mesh parametrisation and soft-body simulation for almost two decades. However, a formulation using Cauchy-Green (CG) invariants has always been unclear, due to a rotation-polluted trace term that cannot be directly expressed using these invariants. We show how this incongruent trace term can be understood via an implicit relationship to the CG invariants. Our analysis reveals this relationship to be a polynomial where the roots equate to the trace term, and where the derivatives also give rise to closed-form expressions of the Hessian to guarantee positive semi-definiteness for a fast and concise Newton-type implicit time integration. A consequence of this analysis is a novel analytical formulation to compute rotations and singular values of deformation-gradient tensors without explicit/numerical factorization, which is significant, resulting in up to 3.5x speedup and benefits energy function evaluation for reducing solver time. We validate our energy formulation by experiments and comparison, demonstrating that our resulting eigendecomposition using the CG invariants is equivalent to existing ARAP formulations. We thus reveal isotropic ARAP energy to be a member of the \"Cauchy-Green club\", meaning that it can indeed be defined using CG invariants and therefore that the closed-form expressions of the resulting Hessian are shared with other energies written in their terms.\""

The library aims at providing a modeling framework capable of simulating not only the energy flows of a greenhouse climate but also the complex interactions and energy flows relative to systems coupling the greenhouse e.g. generation and storage units. In the current literature, a small number of models are openly available for grenhouse climate simulation and crop growth. Although researchers openly present model structures and simulation scenarios, an open-source simulation platform is still lacking. In fact, the most common climate simulation softwares are not open-access and are not able to handle the integration of greenhouses with other thermal systems. The goal of the Greenhouses library is to fill this gap.\n\nFor greenhouse-scale simulation, the proposed library includes the modeling of greenhouse construction elements, indoor climate, heating systems, ventilation systems and crop yield. To the end of performing system-scale simulations, the library includes performance-based models of several generation units e.g., combined heat and power (CHP) and heat pumps. The library also includes control systems for climate control (heating circuit, window's aperture, artificial illumination, etc.) and operation control of the HVAC units.\n\nExplore the Examples package to get a feeling of the modeling possibility that the Greenhouse library offers!\n\nThe documentation is available on the main website: https://greenhouses-library.readthedocs.io\n\nThe Greenhouses package is free software licensed under the 3-clause BSD License.

We are continuously working to design, develop, maintain, and expand energy systems, that will make it possible to use renewable energy nationally and globally. We want to use digitalization as a way to accelerate a market-driven transition towards a sustainable and efficient energy system, and we will build the foundation for both new market participants and business models through digital partnerships. We want to create access to relevant data and insights from the energy market and thereby pushing our goals and direction. We believe that across TSOs, market participants and technology companies, we can support reaching the goals through an open and equal collaboration. Our approach is therefore driven by a strategic belief, that digital development is essential, and societal value creation will follow as we engage and open up. Therefore, we have chosen an approach that we believe best supports our overall vision. We are actively working to maximize value creation both nationally and internationally by choosing a system approach, where we will open up and partner with others to minimize development costs and maximize deployment. We see an opportunity to reduce the cost of software, but also to greatly increase the quality and pace of development through open collaborations. It is a method and approach that we see is increasingly gaining prominence in TSO cooperation. Energinet is not an IT company, and therefore we do not sell systems, services, or operate other TSOs. Our core business is clear, and it must be maintained, but we can contribute to the acceleration of change inside and outside the country, through the methods and tools we use – in this movement we see open source as an important tool. If we can accelerate and disseminate our green digital solutions, we see an opportunity to accelerate the green transition and increase socio economic value creation.\n\nMartin Lundø, Vice President & CEO of Energinet DataHub, part of the Danish TSO Energinet.\n\n<img src=\"./images/energinet.png\" alt=\"Energinet\" style=\"width: 250px; height: auto;\" />\n\n<img src=\"./images/microsoft.png\" alt=\"Microsoft\" style=\"width: 250px; height: auto;\" />\""

Using our proficiencies in core Python, we retrieved weather data from online resources, organized it into easily-accessible data formats and interpreted the data relationships. \n\nThe Austin Energy Predictor outputs forecasted renewable energy in Megawatt-Hours (MWh) generated from a wind and solar energy farm in Texas. The model is used to predict renewable energy output based on time and weather factors, such as temperature, wind speed and cloud coverage.\n\nOur purpose is to forecast power generation to get a better understanding of renewable energy as a mainstream power source for a healthier planet. We hope you enjoy learning about the project! Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. You can find our github and linkedin pages at the bottom.\n\nTo View our Project Dashboard, please visit this link: https://austin-green-energy-predictor.herokuapp.com/\n\nTo View our Project on Google Slides, please visit this link:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bD3JhPvRM_7ClN2xdoWEC1OZS5LJlWrjyJesHR8705s/edit\n\nTo View a recorded, short demonstration (~5 min) of our Project, please visit this link:\n\n\nTo View a recorded, in depth overview (~15 min) of the Project, please visit this link: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx4V56U1gDI&t=1s\n\nThe machine learning model predicts renewable energy output based on weather conditions. Therefore, the model is fed two types of data energy output data (MWh) and weather data. \n\nEnergy Output Data:\nOur team utilized energy output data provided by Austin energy for two of their renewable energy farms: Hackberry Wind Farm and Webberville Solar Farm. The data consists of hourly power generation for each of the renewable energy farms from 2017 through July of https://www.nj.gov/emp/energy/faq.html\n\nThe Hackberry Wind Farm is located west of Dallas, and Webberville Solar Farm is located just outside of Austin. The location of both renewable energy farms as well as Austin Energy’s additional energy farms can be observed below:\n\nBoth of these datasets (found under \"Resources\") are provided directly by Austin Energy and contain the hourly output of the wind/solar farm in Mwh. Take a look below for additional information on each of these farms:\n\n City: Albany, Shackelford\nCommissioning: 2008\n72 turbines: Siemens SWT-2.3-93 (power 2 300 kW, diameter 93 m)\nHub height: 80 m\nTotal nominal power: 165,600 kW\nLatitude: 32° 46' 34\"\nLongitude: -99° 28' 35.2\"\n\n City: Manor, Texas\nCommissioning: 2012\n127,278 PV panels\nTotal nominal power: 35,000 kw\nLatitude: 30° 14' 18\"\nLongitude: -97° 30' 31\"\n\nHistorical weather data for each farm has then been combined with the respective energy output to create two separate datasets one for wind energy and one for solar. Using the Local Historical Weather Online API, multiple API calls were made to collect hourly weather parameters such as temperature, humidity percentage, and cloud coverage for each of the renewable energy farm locations. To ease the merging of the weather and energy output datasets, the data collected also extends the same time frame from January 2017 to July After achieving an accurate machine learning model, forecasted weather data is used to make energy output predictions for Austin Energy’s wind and solar farm.\n\nThe database used for this project is a MongoDB Atlas database hosted on an AWS server. The historical weather data and renewable energy outputs (Mwh) have been cleaned and merged on a DateTime timestamp before inserting the data into the database. The main database is the wind-solar-database, which houses two collections a wind data collection and a solar data collection. These collections can be accessed using the PyMongo driver and a connection \""

Here's how to use the `GreenhouseGeometry` class to generate greenhouses with various roof types.\n\nFirst, you need to import the `GreenhouseGeometry` class from GreenLightPlus. Then, you can specify different roof types and generate a greenhouse model for each type.\n\nWith the above code, you can create greenhouse geometrical models with different roof types. These models can be used for further environment simulations and energy consumption analysis. You can adjust the parameters of the `GreenhouseGeometry` class to suit your specific needs, such as modifying the greenhouse dimensions, roof type, or the simulation time range.\n\nThis functionality is the foundation for understanding and using the GreenLightPlus package, suitable for users who need to perform preliminary simulations and analyses on different greenhouse designs.\n\nThe GreenLightPlus package allows users to run greenhouse simulations using the original GreenLight model and analyze and visualize the results. Here are detailed steps on how to set simulation parameters, run the simulation, and use the `plot_green_light` function to display the results.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules and functions from the GreenLightPlus package.\n\nThis example code demonstrates how to use the GreenLightModel class to run greenhouse environment simulations. By looping through the growing season, the simulation steps through the environmental changes, and the `calculate_energy_consumption` function is used to evaluate energy consumption and yield. Finally, the `plot_green_light` function visualizes the results of the entire simulation process, showing the changes in various environmental parameters inside the greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting and heating energy consumption over time.\n\nThe `plot_green_light` function generates a comprehensive figure displaying the changes in environmental parameters and crop growth dynamics within the simulated greenhouse. The figure includes the following subplots:\n\nIndoor and outdoor temperature in degrees Celsius ($^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$).\nIndoor and outdoor vapor pressure in Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$).\nIndoor and outdoor relative humidity as a percentage ($\\%$).\nIndoor and outdoor CO2 concentration in both milligrams per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}}$) and parts per million ($\\mathrm{ppm}$).\nOutdoor global solar radiation, PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) above the canopy from both sun and lamps, lamp electric input, and PAR above the canopy from sun and lamps separately, all in Watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$).\nPPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) from the sun and lamps in micromoles of PAR per square meter per second ($\\mathrm{\\mu mol\\,(PAR)\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$).\nNet assimilation of CO2, net photosynthesis, growth respiration, and maintenance respiration in milligrams per square meter per second ($\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$).\nFruit, stem, and leaf dry weight in milligrams of CH2O per square meter ($\\mathrm{mg\\,(CH_2O)\\,m^{-2}}$), buffer content also in $\\mathrm{mg\\,(CH_2O)\\,m^{-2}}$, and LAI (Leaf Area Index) in square meters per square meter ($\\mathrm{m^2\\,m^{-2}}$).\nFruit dry weight in milligrams of CH2O per square meter ($\\mathrm{mg\\,(CH_2O)\\,m^{-2}}$) and fruit harvest in milligrams of CH2O per square meter per second ($\\mathrm{mg\\,(CH_2O)\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$).\nVarious temperature states of the greenhouse components in degrees Celsius ($^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$).\n\nGreenLightPlus integrates the GreenLight model and EnergyPlus, providing higher accuracy greenhouse environment simulations and more detailed energy consumption analyses.\n\nFirst, ensure that you have added the EnergyPlus installation directory to the Python module search path. Then, import the required modules and functions from the GreenLightPlus package.\n\nThis example code demonstrates how to use the `GreenhouseSimulation` class and the EnergyPlus API to run greenhouse environment simulations that combine the GreenLight model with EnergyPlus. This simulation will use EnergyPlus for detailed energy consumption analysis, while incorporating the crop growth and environmental control models provided by GreenLight.\n\nAfter the simulation is completed, statistics on total yield, lighting input, and boiler input will be output. This data helps users evaluate the effectiveness of the greenhouse design and control strategies, as well as their impact on energy consumption and yield.\n\nGreenLightPlus integrates a reinforcement learning environment, allowing users to utilize reinforcement learning algorithms (such as PPO) to optimize greenhouse management and operation strategies. Here are the steps to configure and run PPO training.\n\nFirst, you need to import the `GreenhouseEnv` environment from GreenLightPlus and configure the PPO algorithm from Ray RLlib.\n\nThis example code demonstrates how to use Ray RLlib and the PPO algorithm to train a reinforcement learning model for greenhouse environment optimization. By adjusting the environment parameters and training settings, you can explore different strategies to improve the greenhouse's energy efficiency and crop yield.\n\nCheckpoints will be saved periodically during the training process, and the current training results will be printed. These results help users evaluate the algorithm's performance and iteratively optimize the greenhouse management strategies.\n\nContributions through Pull Requests or Issues for feature enhancements or bug reports are welcome.\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 License.

Each base station (BS) is randomly deployed within a given area and is equipped with M antennas to serve K user equipments (UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum meansquared error. The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density and achieves its maximum for a relatively small BS densification, irrespective of the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope (distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic non-decreasing function of BS densification. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency, which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor, number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed-form expressions are computed from which valuable insights into the interplay between the optimization variables, hardware characteristics, and propagation environment can be obtained.\n\nThe package contains 3 folders which can be used to generate the 5 simulation figures as they appear in the article. The folder \"ComputeULAvgErgodicSE\" compute the uplink average ergodic spectral efficiency as seen in Theorem 2 in the article. The results obtained by running the main script in this folder are then saved in another folder called \"SimulationResults\". Finally, the scripts included in the folder \"GenerateSimulationFigures\" generate the figures in the article by using the simulation results computed beforehand.\n\nSee each script and function for further documentation.\n\nThis code package is licensed under the GPLv2 license.

(c) Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nGreen Trust is the prototype solution for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), based on Blockchain. It uses as effective PoS public/private hybrid blockchain to allow its users to issue and trade RECs.\n\nRenewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are designed as a market-based instrument to provide an economic incentive for electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Each REC represents proof that 1 MWh of renewable energy has been produced and embodies the environmental benefits that amount of renewable energy generated. REC registries electronically issue RECs based on renewable energy generators’ output. A REC, and its associated attributes and benefits, can be sold together or separately from the underlying physical electricity associated with the renewable-energy generation. RECs are an effective and recognised way of reaching emission targets and improving sustainability.\n\nWaves Enterprise is a Proof of Stake blockchain for highly regulated industries, to which enterprise blockchain adopters are switching because of its powerful docker based smart contracts, mining efficiency and minimal fees, compared to Ethereum. EasyChain is a low-code Platform, that allows its users to create smart contracts without coding, using visual development tools and diagrams. Together, this tech allowed us to build GreenTrust a complete solution for issuing legally correct RECs in form of NFT tokens. Simple and easy way to issue RECs is an important way of supporting Renewable Energy Producers.\n\nGreenTrust connects all parties, involved in RECs lifecycle. It operates using its internal token (GRT) to buy/sell RECs. This token may further become a platform's governance tokens. GreenTrust allows energy producers to connect their IoT devices to the system, automatically issuing RECs. Each REC is represented by an NFT token. RECs can be traded on built in marketplace. Additional parties, such as regulators are required to make RECs legally binding, and they will be different in different jurisdictions.\n\nRECs and associated processes can be quite intimidating to beginners. Here is our explanation and demo of the product. Watch our solution presentation: And live demo: Feel free to play with our demo using the following users:\n\nEnergy producer: pro_user2  \nRegulator (governance): ca_user2  \nVerifier: ver_user2  \nBuyer: user22  \nPassword (for all users): userpass\n\nAlso, you can check out demo using username and password Demo1@demo.demo\""

It is a tool meant for developers to enable them to make their sites more sustainable, and with that, cut the unnecessary energy consumption and the associated carbon emissions.\n\nOur main goal is to provide developers with additional support when designing a new website or re-designing an existing website for sustainability. To make it as convenient as possible to use, we integrated the functionality in form of a plug-in that can be used directly in the Chrome™ browser during web design.\n\nGreenSites checks the following:\n\n- **Images (`<img>`):**\n  - Checks whether the images are being loaded and not being rendered\n  - Checks whether an image resolution is larger than its displayed size\n  - Checks which image file types are being used\n\n- **Videos (`<video>`):**\n  - Checks whether `autoplay` is enabled\n\n- **Fonts:**\n  - Checks for loading of external fonts instead of using system fonts\n\n- **Lazy loading:**\n  - Checks the following element types for usage of lazy-loading:\n    - Images (`<img>`)\n    - Videos (`<video>`)\n    - iFrames (`<iframe>`)\n\n- **Content Delivery Network usage (CDN):**\n  - Checks whether a website's HTTPS response is loaded using a CDN\n  - Checks whether the following element types are loaded using a CDN:\n    - Images (`<img>`)\n    - Videos (`<video>`)\n    - iFrames (`<iframe>`)\n    - Scripts (`<script>`)\n\nSee the details page in the plugin for explanations of the features.\n\nThe extension makes use of https://websitecarbon.com for displaying the energy consumption of the website. The measures were based mainly on the following checklist: https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/.\n\nThe plugin is currently in active development, therefore it has not been published on the Chrome Webstore. If you would like to make use of GreenSites now, please clone the repository and follow the steps on how to integrate the source code into your Chrome™ browser.\n\nWithin the browser, you can use GreenSites as you would use any other plug-in. When you run the plug-in, you will get a drop-down menu with buttons targeting the specific element type check. For more details on the specific element groups and explanations on the associated warnings, click on the helper icon with the question mark to open a new page with the information.\n\nIf you found an issue with the plug-in or have a new feature request, you can report it to our GitHub issues page. To make it clear what your issue refers to, please use one of our templates. If you are missing a label, let us know in the issues!\n\nGreenSites is an open-source project, and thus we invite anyone and everyone interested in web development or simply improving the plug-in. To make your contribution process as smooth as possible, please see our instructions on contributing and read the code of conduct before adding a contribution.\""

This project focuses on forecasting the hourly building energy demand of 9 buildings in total from the CityLearn Challenge, based on 4 years energy consumption and weather data. The presentation of the project can be found .\n\nSince energy prices are continuing to rise and the future of the energy situation is rather uncertain, cities may want to investigate the energy consumption of different building sectors to predict future energy demand and identify areas where energy can be saved.\n\nEnergy demand forecasting is fundamental for an energy utility’s decision making on:\n\n- Grid stability\n- Planning power supply activities\n- Reducing energy wastage\n\nSince the data available consists of a series of energy consumption values taken sequentially with a fixed time interval over four years, time series analysis and models are ideal for this problem.\n\nThe dataset we used for this project consists of:\n- Synthetic data of 4 years, 9 buildings from the CityLearn Challenge (southern US suburb)\n- Hourly data of energy demand and solar generation\n- Hourly weather data (temperature, humidity, solar radiation)\n\nThe nine buildings in this dataset consist of:\n- Building 1: Office building\n- Building 2: Fast food restaurant\n- Building 3: Standalone retail\n- Building 4: Strip mall retail\n- Buildings 5-9: Multi-family buildings\n\nOur goal is to model the net energy demand of a collection of 9 buildings which are part of the .\n\nFirst, the time series data was analyzed for trend and seasonality. It seemed suitable to forecast the energy demand for 24 hours, as weather predictions get less accurate further in the future. Else, the power suppliers energy management is mainly focused on a 24 hour period.\n\nDifferent models were applied and compared:\n- Baseline (last year's values)\n- Linear Regression\n- Polynomial Regression\n- SARIMAX\n- Prophet\n- TBats\n- XGBoost\n- Random Forest\n\nA small trend in the net energy demand over 4 years was discovered with a slight increase over the first 3 years and a decrease in the 4th year (corresponding to the trend in the weather data). A clear yearly seasonality is found with the highest energy demand in summer (due to air conditioning) and the lowest energy demand in winter (due to mild winters). Furthermore, a weekly as well as a daily seasonality was identified.\n\nModel benchmark:\n- The tree-based machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) performed better than the time series models (SARIMAX, Prophet, TBats) taking the mean absolute error as metric.\n\nForecast for 24 hours:\n- The tree-based machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) produced forecasts with the lowest mean absolute error compared to the observed data.\n\nThe dashboard can be used to present the models' results and compare them for any date in the test year (year 4 = 2022). The dashboard can be found hosted here: \n\nThe project notebooks require a `pyenv` with Python: 3.9.8. To properly set up the environment, use the requirements file in the repository as follows:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nor\n```bash\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\nThe `requirements.txt` file contains the libraries needed for EDA, Time Series Analysis, and the dashboard deployment. The time series models' results (MAE, MSE, and R2) are trackable through MLflow. The required MLFLOW URI file is not part of this repository. Before running the time series Jupyter notebooks and locally save the results, you require a `.mlflow_uri` file in the repository root. In bash, do:\n```bash\necho \"http://localhost:5000\" > .mlflow_uri\n```\nThis will create a local file where the URI is stored, which will not be added to GitHub (`.mlflow_uri` is in the `.gitignore` file). Before running the time series notebook, check your local MLflow by:\n```bash\nmlflow ui\n```\nand open the link.\n\nThe dashboard deployment can be accessed by running:\n```bash\nmlflow ui\n```\nand opening the link.\n\nOriginal data is available at <link>. Preprocessed data for our analysis is located at the repository.\n\nJupyter notebooks are divided into two sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series (TS) models. These sections are part of the notebook prefix name.\n\n| EDA | Description |\n|:---|:---|\n| Data setup for time series analysis |\n| Exploratory analysis on weather variables. e.g. Temperature, Solar radiation. |\n| Seasonality decomposition. Moving average period = 7 days |\n| Data visualization |\n| Yearly seasonality decomposition. And meteorological seasons analysis. Moving average period = 7 days |\n\n| TS 8-day prediction models | Description |\n|:---|:---|\n| Previous 24 hrs energy demand value |\n| Model with weather and time features |\n| Linear regression model with polynomial features including weather and time features |\n| Model with weather, yearly and weekly seasonalities as exogenous features |\n| Model with hyperparameter optimization, holidays, weather data as additional regressors and weekly seasonality by meteorological seasons |\n| Model including weather features and time features. Net energy demand as target. Additionally a 24-hour time lag 1, 2, 3 weeks time lag of the target feature is used |\n| Model including weather features and time features. Additionally a 24-hour time lag 1, 2, 3 weeks time lag of the target feature is used. Every energy demand is predicted separately and summed up afterwards |\n| Model including weather features and time features. Net energy demand as target. Additionally a 24-hour time lag and 1 week time lag of the target feature is used |\n\nWe have two approaches for our future work. A business approach and a Machine Learning optimization approach.\n\nFor our business-oriented future work, we plan to implement a dashboard solution to predict real-time energy demand. The solution will allow stockholders to feed current data, helping them with their decisions to balance their energy demand.\n\nFor our Machine Learning optimization approach, we plan to optimize the models' generalization with respect to different climate zones. Our plan is to evaluate a solution for all climate zones vs. individual climate zone solutions. Furthermore, we plan to develop a reinforcement learning agent(s) with the aim of battery usage optimization towards cost reduction and energy grid stability improvement.\""

It records a timestamp on Ethereum to show the records of compensated footprint and is able to prove ownership from credits of a green energy source.\n\nThe stakeholders are trying to achieve a tracker system that can certify the compensation of buyers of the output from a green energy source. There’s no pre-existent software offering this kind of solution to track client’s energy footprint at the moment and the stakeholders want to utilize cutting-edge technology to address that problem.\n\nUsing IOTs devices and tokenizing the green credits certificates and programming blockchain smart contracts and encapsulate all that in a mobile interface so the user can fast interact in a secure form will allow companies to buy the credits they need to cover their footprints with easy.\n\nThe success of this project will be measured by crypto income provided by the negotiations registered in the blockchain. All the transactions involving the GET Token will provide a cut to the developers.\n\nThere are companies that need to prove that they compensate their footprints and there is no easy, fast and secure way to do it nowadays. All the process is costly and slow, it’s a lot of steps that demand a lot of effort with a lot of thirty parties involved.\n\nFirstly, we intend to measure the footprint using IOTs device that will record the company’s emissions. Those devices will then be connected with Smart Contracts. Companies now will know how many credits they need to buy to compensate its footprint. To allow an easy way to do the transactions, companies will buy the credits in form of tokens, crypto assets that represent the real certificate, from a simple mobile interface. With the tokens in hand, companies will pay for the footprint they need to compensate. All the transactions will be stored in the blockchain. The report events can be followed in real-time again, simply by using a mobile interface.\n\nA group of entrepreneurs and blockchain developers, all ex-students from the Blockchain Development program at George Brown College. A small team using cutting edge-technologies that want to revolutionize the way people work with green credit compensations actually.\n\nWith a tech background, we have electric engineers, computer engineers, computer scientists. Each one playing an important role in the deployment of this solution bringing accumulated knowledge and experiences.\n\nThe project management will be done by Alexandre, the smart contract by Michael, the web interface by Alexei, and quality assurance and test-cases will be Dhruvan responsibility. In fact, they all will act together helping each other since they all have the necessary’s skills to do so but since the task needs to be divided it was decided that.\n\nThe main restriction of this project is the short time and the budget. It all will be made in just one sprint (Agile/Scrum) with no resources to cover any paid program. That said, all the frameworks will use open-source solutions.\n\nWe will use some dummy contents to measure the result of this project, we will consider it a success if our MVP could do all the transactions intended. With this application validated the stakeholders will then look after venture capital to prepare the solution to the market.\n\nToken representation of green source certificates needed to compensate footprints.\n\nData&time, green energy source, footprint emitted, footprint compensated\n\nThe system is tracking all the companies’ compensated footprint.\n\nWe will cover a single company as a client and a single green energy source as a provider.\n\nNo money will be invested at this time, only professionals' teams and efforts.\n\nWe will need to capture the footprint generated by the company and measured by the IOT device. We’re going to use sample data to simulate that in this phase.\n\nReports of the footprint compensated will be generated and displayed in a web interface.\n\nWe will provide a mobile interface to buy credits online.\n\nBuyers can only buy credits within a 24 hours interval.\n\nBuyers can buy more than 10 times inside the month.\n\nOwnership cannot be changed.

The 3 most common gases are carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThere are several sources of greenhouse gases, such as transportation, industry, commercial and residental. In this document I will tackle the problem in a general way, considering the impact of energy consumption on greenhouse gases emissions. Energy is indeed strictly related to almost all source factors. In particular, I will face the modelling of causal relations between energy consumption and greenhouse gases in Italy using a Bayesian network. The aim is to learn a model that can provide probabilistic results given some input evidence. The causal relations and their relative probabilities will be estimated by analyzing annual growth factors of several indicators from open source datasets of the World Bank Group (WBG). The choice of analyzing the annual growth aims to capture how the variation of an indicator can affect the others.\n\nThis work starts from a paper by Cinar and Kayakutlu (2010) in which the authors produced estimates about energy investments in Turkey given historical data. Their work helped me to come up with interesting measures to be investigated and to be represented in the Bayesian network. I could extend their work adding: a more comprehensive analysis of network properties (conditional independencies, active trails, Markov blankets), concise and effective high level functions (such as query_report, check_assertion and active_trails_of) to express the most significant properties in a readable format and the whole code to learn the Bayesian network from the available datasets.\n\n<a name=\"first\">\n\n<a name=\"second\">\n\n<a name=\"third\">\""

Bandwidth aggregation over LTE and WiFi links offers an attractive opportunity for supporting bandwidth-intensive services, such as high-quality video streaming, on mobile devices.\n\n introduces an energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation middleware that supports real-time data-streaming services over asymmetric wireless links, requiring no modification to the existing Internet infrastructure. The  was published on the 34th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS '13).\n\nGreenBag was designed to download via LTE and WiFi but the current version does not automatically detect those network interfaces in the system. Therefore, you need to add the interface names to the corresponding lookup lists in . On a desktop with multiple network interfaces, you need to specify one into the LTE list and the other into the WiFi list.\n\nThis source code can be built for Android and Linux desktop platforms. The following build commands for desktops were tested with gcc 5.4.0 on Ubuntu 16. You can build on Android by using gcc in Android NDK.\n\nStandalone mode: In this mode, GreenBag works like a typical downloader, such as wget.  \n`make standalone`\n\nProxy mode: In this mode, GreenBag acts as a proxy between the server and the video player. GreenBag was originally designed to work on this mode, but it requires some additional setup steps.  \n`make`\n\nI tested with an Apache2 server which allows an unlimited maximum number of requests during a persistent connection. Because GreenBag sends a lot of requests over persistent connections, you need to set MaxKeepAliveRequests large enough on the server's configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`)\n\nAlthough Android will automatically set up routing tables correctly when there are multiple network interfaces in the system, desktop Linux distributions typically do not. You can set up the routing tables on Linux using .\n\n\nRun GreenBag with fixed segment sizes (`-F 1`), each segment is 2048 KB large (`-S 2048`)  \n`./gb http://143.248.140.50:8088/files/Gangnam.mp4 -F 1 -S 2048`\n\nThe first argument is the URL to download, and later arguments are options for GreenBag. The performance mode (not energy-saving mode) is used by default.\n\nMore options could be found in .\n\nThe download time should be faster than when using wget to download over a single link:  \n`wget http://server.com/files/1GB`  \n`wget --bind-address=$ip0 http://server.com/files/1GB`  \n`wget --bind-address=$ip1 http://server.com/files/1GB`\n\nIf the speed of GreenBag is not faster than wget, you may check the traffic over network interfaces using . The traffic of both network interfaces should be high. If network traffic flows through only one interface, please check the routing table settings.\n\nIn case that the network bottleneck is on the middleboxes or the server side, bandwidth aggregation will not be faster than single-link downloading.\n\nYou can also throttle bandwidth for testing by using . An example script is .\n\n\nDoes not automatically determine the optimal segment sizes. Future versions should support flexible segment sizes and be adaptive to the changing network conditions such as bandwidth and RTT.\nDoes not automatically detect network interfaces in the system.\nDoes not automatically determine whether a network interface is LTE or WiFi.\nUses disk to store in-progress file parts. Future versions should try to store them in memory.\nRequires large MaxKeepAliveRequests on the server side. Future versions should reduce the number of requests sent over each persistent connection.\nDoes not determine bitrates of videos automatically.\nDoes not set up routing tables on the client automatically.\n\nIn order to enable LTE and WiFi simultaneously you need to modify the ConnectivityService of the Android Framework. On proprietary phones where the source code of the Android Framework is not available, you may need to reverse engineer and modify the ConnectivityService module.\n\nMore details are available in .\""

Moreover, our ever-increasing energy demand forces us to consider the energy sources as a primary factor in terms of climate change. In the European energy market, the drive for clean and sustainable energy has led to a strong market for renewable sources primarily in terms of solar and wind power. Conversely, the demand for conventional energy production via fossil-fuel and nuclear sources has been declining. For the energy market investor, the future profitability of new and existing fossil-fuel power plants must be considered before placing significant investments. For the energy producer, the profitability of a coal or gas power plant must be considered for daily operation.\n\nAny energy market cannot, however, consist of only renewable energy sources - the uncertainty in their energy production still requires the contribution of conventional sources. Additionally, the recent advances in energy storage allow the use of excess power to pump water into storage dams for later use. For the fossil fuel power plant operator, this leads to the question of daily operation: \"should the plant operate today or not, based on required load, forecast weather, and energy price?\"\""

This variability can strain energy grids and affect the stability of power supply. Some challenges associated with solar energy prediction include:\n    Weather Forecasting Accuracy: Accurate solar energy predictions rely on precise weather forecasts. However, weather predictions, especially for longer time horizons, can have uncertainties. Small errors in weather forecasts can lead to significant discrepancies in solar energy production predictions.\n    Data Availability and Quality: Reliable historical weather data and solar energy production data are essential for training accurate prediction models. Data gaps or inaccuracies can lead to less reliable predictions.\n    Limited Forecasting Horizon: Weather forecasts typically provide predictions for a few days in advance. Accurate long-term predictions are more challenging to obtain, which can limit the ability to plan for future solar energy production accurately.\n    Grid Integration and Demand Fluctuations: Accurate predictions are crucial for grid operators to manage the integration of solar power into the electricity grid. Fluctuations in energy demand and supply must be balanced in real-time, which requires precise forecasts.\n    Geographic Variability: Solar energy potential varies significantly by geographic location. Accurate predictions require taking into account the specific conditions and solar resources of each region.\n\nSolution: Solar Wise Energy Forecast is a machine learning powered algorithm that forecasts solar energy production based on up-to-date weather conditions. Accurate green energy forecasting can help energy grid operators efficiently manage the integration of renewable energy sources, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and minimize energy waste. The program could contribute to a more sustainable energy ecosystem and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nData Collection  \nWe gathered historical data on weather conditions and corresponding energy production data from solar energy farms. \n\nData Processing & Features Engineering  \nWe decided on the following relevant features from the weather data that can impact solar energy production: cloud cover duration, visibility, dew point, humidity, windspeed, and solar energy. \n\nWeather Forecast  \nWe leveraged weather predictions obtained from a Visual Crossing's API, which supplies detailed weather forecasts for the upcoming 14 days. Additionally, we explored the possibility of incorporating Google DeepMind's GraphCast, a state-of-the-art AI model just launched earlier this week that is capable of delivering exceptionally accurate 10-day weather predictions in under one minute. GraphCast offers advanced capabilities such as predicting the tracks of cyclones and identifying atmospheric rivers associated with flood risk, which could provide early warnings of extreme weather events. However, due to constraints in computing resources, we were unable to integrate GraphCast into our current model. This remains a promising avenue for future enhancements to our forecasting capabilities. \n\nPrediction of Solar Energy Production  \nArmed with accurate weather forecasts, we leveraged machine learning models to predict solar energy production based on various weather conditions. Our model underwent rigorous testing with multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Long-Short Term Memory, and AdaBoosting. Remarkably, our AdaBoosting model achieved an impressive R-squared value of 96%, providing a reliable prediction of solar energy production, essential for informed energy management in Boston. For scalability, we plan to transition to Google Cloud's AutoML model training and deployment tool, VertexAI, as our dataset grows. Despite initial attempts, we encountered limitations due to the dataset's size. \n\nVisualization and Reporting  \nTo make our predictions accessible to users, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application. This application allows users to input their location (address, city, zipcode, etc.) and receive a 14-day forecast of solar energy production. The prediction comes from the Visual Crossing API. Utilizing our prediction model and API calls, we retrieve real-time and forecasted weather data and calculate the anticipated solar energy production. Furthermore, our application calculates the potential carbon emission reductions and cost savings achieved by transitioning to solar energy, bringing the climate benefits of renewable energy adoption closer to home. \n\nWhat impacts can predicting solar energy production have?\nEnvironment & Sustainability \nGreen energy production is environmentally friendly. However, if we don’t maximize our use of green energy, we could be needlessly relying on fossil fuel when it is unnecessary. Accurate predictions allow us to improve the efficiency of green energy by having better management of energy resources and reducing the need for backup fossil fuel plants. Carbon Emission Reduction: By enabling users to forecast solar energy production, this project empowers individuals and organizations to reduce their reliance on traditional, fossil fuel-based energy sources. As a result, it directly contributes to carbon emission reduction efforts. Climate Justice: By providing accurate solar energy forecasts, we empower Boston's diverse communities to make informed decisions about their energy consumption. This not only reduces their reliance on fossil fuels but also contributes to a more equitable and sustainable energy landscape. Climate Resilience: The integration of GraphCast's advanced weather predictions, although currently beyond our technical scope, holds immense potential for early warnings of extreme weather events. This capability directly contributes to Boston's climate resilience efforts, safeguarding communities from the impacts of climate change. \n\nResource Planning \nResource planning: Green energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning their energy production fluctuates based on weather conditions and time of day. Predicting their output helps grid operators and energy providers plan for periods of high and low energy production to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply. Grid stability: Accurate predictions of green energy production enable grid operators to balance the supply and demand of electricity. This helps prevent blackouts and brownouts by ensuring that enough energy is available when needed. Integration of renewables: As the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix grows, it becomes crucial to integrate them efficiently into the existing energy infrastructure. Predictions of green energy production allow for better coordination with traditional power sources, reducing the need for backup fossil fuel generation and optimizing grid operations. \n\nFinancial Saving \nEnergy companies and investors need to make long-term decisions about infrastructure investments in renewable energy projects. Accurate predictions of green energy production help assess the viability and profitability of such projects. Accurate predictions help energy providers avoid overcommitting or underutilizing resources. This can lead to cost savings by reducing the need for expensive peaker plants and minimizing energy wastage during periods of oversupply. \n\nPolicies and Regulation \nGovernments and regulatory bodies use production forecasts to develop policies and regulations that promote the growth of renewable energy. Predictions provide essential data for setting renewable energy targets, incentivizing investments, and monitoring progress. \n\nIn summary, our project goes beyond technical innovation; it offers a tangible solution that addresses climate challenges, enhances climate justice, and fosters climate resilience. Our commitment to accurate solar energy forecasting, informed decision-making, and cutting-edge technology reflects our dedication to preparing Boston for the impacts of climate change and achieving a more sustainable future.\""

Additionally, it can protect content even after decryption is done. An efficient digital watermark embedding algorithm for color images, which is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the spectral characteristics of the human vision system. Firstly, three color separations are performed for color images, and color components of the color image are transformed by DWT. Secondly, the embedding position of the watermark is confirmed by comparing the energy value of the low frequency sub-band in the transformed blue component and green component. Thirdly, the watermark is made using Arnold Transform for encryption and is embedded in the color component with a larger power. Simulation results showed that the embedded watermark had good invisibility and robustness for common image processing, such as filtering, noise, especially compression and cropping.\""

Offering carbon credits for purchase might not lead to adoption while requiring carbon credits as part of NFT minting might deter the growth of NFTs. Creators, who already struggle to earn a living due to high gas fees, cannot afford an additional $10 to $15 surcharge per NFT minted. Instead of focusing only on carbon credits, we need sustainable minting options from the start.\n\nCreators and researchers disagree on early figures suggest that minting an NFT on Ethereum requires 35 kWh or 8,600 grams of CO2 due to the lack of verified and audited data on energy consumption and sources from minting. Much of the data focuses on energy consumption (calculations based on the hashrate) from the process of how blockchain data is verified (ex. proof of stake vs. proof of work) while the sources from minting remain unclear.\n\nMiners play an important role in reducing carbon emissions of the blockchain, and therefore, should receive incentives to make data transparent and for efforts for greener minting. Miners make critical decisions on the supply chain acquisition of infrastructure, property maintenance of facilities and surrounding land, and energy sources that fuel the mining.\n\nMiners can join the Regen Network protocol to verify data on land restoration and supply chain, while the Regen Network protocol can provide REGEN tokens to contributing miners and supply the data to share with NFT marketplaces and specific blockchain community members.\n\nThough there is no protocol related to energy courses on the Regen Network, in the future, Regen Network can integrate with tracking systems which are electronic databases that register basic information about each megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable generation for enterprise businesses. Basing off of the current data integrity validation method on Regen, credible tracking systems can upload renewable energy certificates to IPFS or another permanent URL and point it to a geographic identifier of the mining facility.\n\nMany minting facilities are abandoned, formerly industrial properties (ex. factories) that were refurbished for minting. Through the Regen Network Ecological State Protocols (ESPs), they can continue to verify and get rewarded for land restoration improvements. For example, a former plant converted into a minting facility can track the change in methane gas using the Methane Emissions Protocol and receive returns of $5 an hectare a year or more.\n\nThe concept of a community mining facility can become a reality. NFT creators can participate in the land restoration of mining facilities of blockchains that they mint on and earn credits. NFT marketplaces and major businesses that mint NFTs can contribute financial resources in a DAO-like structure for land restoration as well as renewable energy sources integration.\n\nIn addition, registration of a project on Regen can be included in a proposal of new mining facilities. The Regen Network can partner with specific blockchains to offer new miners opportunities to register a project and participate in a full project lifecycle on Regen.\n\nMiners can utilize a combination of the Supply Protocol and oracles of supply chain tracking data (ex. from XYO) to ensure a more sustainable supply chain of mining infrastructure.\n\nNFT marketplaces can utilize the Regen Ledger and APIs, as well as buy data on the Regen marketplace, to show the CO2 emissions and restorative land practices of mining facilities to creators and fans. \n\nThe comprehensiveness of the data and emphasis on ecological change of land would better help NFT creators evaluate the ecological impact of minting NFTs on a specific blockchain, as opposed to calculating just energy consumption. By incentivizing miners to provide the data, NFT creators will no longer need to guess the long-term sustainability of a blockchain.\""

It is a full-fledged primitive equation ocean model that supports anything between idealized toy models and realistic configurations. And because Veros is written in pure Python, the days of struggling with complicated model setup workflows, ancient programming environments, and obscure legacy code are finally over.\n\n*In a nutshell, we want to enable high-performance ocean modelling with a clear focus on flexibility and usability. Veros supports a NumPy backend for small-scale problems, and a high-performance backend with CPU and GPU support. It is fully parallelized via MPI and supports distributed execution on any number of nodes, including multi-GPU architectures (see also ).\n\nThe dynamical core of Veros is based on NEMO, an ocean model with a Fortran backend and Fortran and Python frontends.\n\nTo learn more about Veros, make sure to visit our documentation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/391237951\">\n      <img src=\"doc/_images/veros-preview.gif?raw=true\" alt=\"0.25×0.25° high-resolution model spin-up\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n(0.25×0.25° high-resolution model spin-up, click for better\nquality)\n</p>\n\nVeros provides\n\na fully staggered **3-D grid geometry*(*C-grid*)\nsupport for both **idealized and realistic configurations*in\n    Cartesian or pseudo-spherical coordinates\nseveral **friction and advection schemes*isoneutral mixing, eddy-kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy,\n    and internal wave energy **parameterizations*several **pre-implemented diagnostics*such as energy fluxes,\n    variable time averages, and a vertical overturning stream function\n    (written to netCDF4 output)\n**pre-configured idealized and realistic set-ups*that are ready to\n    run and easy to adapt\n**accessibility and extensibility*thanks to the\n    power of Python!\n\nA minimal example to install and run Veros:\n\nFor more detailed installation instructions, have a look at [our\ndocumentation](https://veros.readthedocs.io).\n\nTo run Veros, you need to set up a model --i.e., specify which settings\nand model domain you want to use. This is done by subclassing the\n`VerosSetup` base class in a *setup script that is written in Python. You\nshould use the `veros copy-setup` command to copy one into your current\nfolder. A good place to start is the\n:\n\nAfter setting up your model, all you need to do is call the `setup` and\n`run` methods on your setup class. The pre-implemented setups can all be\nexecuted via `veros run`:\n\nFor more information on using Veros, have a look at [our\ndocumentation](http://veros.readthedocs.io).\n\nContributions to Veros are always welcome, no matter if you spotted an\ninaccuracy in our documentation, wrote a\nnew setup, fixed a bug, or even extended Veros' core mechanics.

There are no planned updates as of this time (early 2022). The last version of this database is version 1.3. If we learn of active forks or maintained versions of the code and database we will attempt to provide links in the future.\n\nThis project aims to build . It is the result of a large collaboration involving many partners, coordinated by the  and . If you would like to get involved, please  or fork the repo and code! To learn more about how to contribute to this repository, read the  document.\n\nThe latest database release (v1.3.0) is available in CSV format  under a . A bleeding-edge version is in the  directory of this repo.\n\nAll Python source code is available under a .\n\nThis work is made possible and supported by , among other organizations.\n\nThe Global Power Plant Database is built in several steps.\n\nThe first step involves gathering and processing country-level data. In some cases, these data are read automatically from official government websites; the code to implement this is in the `build_databases` directory. In other cases we gather country-level data manually. These data are saved in `raw_source_files/WRI` and processed with the `build_database_WRI.py` script in the `build_database` directory.\n\nThe second step is to integrate data from different sources, particularly for geolocation of power plants and annual total electricity generation. Some of these different sources are multi-national databases. For this step, we rely on offline work to match records; the concordance table mapping record IDs across databases is saved in resources/master_plant_concordance.csv.\n\nThroughout the processing, we represent power plants as instances of the `PowerPlant` class, defined in `powerplant_database.py`. The final database is in a flat-file CSV format.\n\nThe database includes the following indicators:\n\nPlant name\nFuel type(s)\nGeneration capacity\nCountry\nOwnership\nLatitude/longitude of plant\nData source & URL\nData source year\nAnnual generation\n\nWe will expand this list in the future as we extend the database.\n\nWe define the \"Fuel Type\" attribute of our database based on common fuel categories. In order to parse the different fuel types used in our various data sources, we map fuel name synonyms to our fuel categories . We plan to expand the database in the future to report more disaggregated fuel types.\n\nA major challenge for this project is that data come from a variety of sources, including government ministries, utility companies, equipment manufacturers, crowd-sourced databases, financial reports, and more. The reliability of the data varies, and in many cases there are conflicting values for the same attribute of the same power plant from different data sources. To handle this, we match and de-duplicate records and then develop rules for which data sources to report for each indicator. We provide a clear  for each datum in the database. We plan to ultimately allow users to choose alternative rules for which data sources to draw on.\n\nTo the maximum extent possible, we read data automatically from trusted sources, and integrate it into the database. Our current strategy involves these steps:\n\nAutomate data collection from machine-readable national data sources where possible.\nFor countries where machine-readable data are not available, gather and curate power plant data by hand, and then match these power plants to plants in other databases, including GEO and CARMA (see below) to determine their geolocation.\nFor a limited number of countries with small total power-generation capacity, use data directly from Global Energy Observatory (GEO).\n\nA table describing the data source(s) for each country is listed below.\n\nFinally, we are examining ways to automatically incorporate data from the following supra-national data sources:\n\nWe assign a unique ID to each line of data that we read from each source. In some cases, these represent plant-level data, while in other cases they represent unit-level data. In the case of unit-level data, we commonly perform an aggregation step and assign a new, unique plant-level ID to the result. For plants drawn from machine-readable national data sources, the reference ID is formed by a three-letter country code  and a seven-digit number. For plants drawn from other databases (including the manually-maintained dataset by WRI), the reference ID is formed by a variable-size prefix code and a seven-digit number.\n\nIn many cases our data sources do not include power plant geolocation information. To address this, we attempt to match these plants with the GEO and CARMA databases, in order to use that geolocation data. We use an  developed by Enipedia to perform the matching based on plant name, country, capacity, location, with confirmed matches stored in a concordance file. This matching procedure is complex and the algorithm we employ can sometimes wrongly match two power plants or fail to match two entries for the same power plant. We are investigating using the Duke framework for matching, which allows us to do the matching offline.\n\nThe build system is as follows\n\nCreate a virtual environment with Python 2.7 and the third-party packages in `requirements.txt`\n`cd` into `build_databases/`\nrun each `build_database_*.py` file for each data source or processing method that changed (when making a database update)\nrun `build_global_power_plant_database.py` which reads from the pickled store/sub-databases.\n`cd` into `../utils`\nrun `database_country_summary.py` to produce summary table\n`cd` into `../output_database`\ncopy `global_power_plant_database.csv` to the  repository. Look at the `Makefile` in that repo to understand where it should be located\nbuild new generation estimations as needed based on plant changes and updates compared to the stored and calculated values this is not automatic, but there are some helper scripts for making the estimates\nrun the `make_gppd.py` script in `gppd-ai4earth-api` to construct a new version of the database with the full estimation data\ncopy the new merged dataset back to this repo, increment the `DATABASE_VERSION` file, commit, etc...\""

Climate change is a global issue that impacts all regions of the world and all sectors of the global economy. Thus, any responses to the threat of climate change, such as policies or international agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions, can have wide ranging consequences throughout the energy system as well as on land use and land cover. Integrated assessment models endeavor to represent all world regions and all sectors of the economy in an economic framework in order to explore interactions between sectors and understand the potential ramifications of climate mitigation actions.\n\nGCAM has been developed at PNNL for over 20 years and is now a freely available community model and documented online (See below). The team at JGCRI is comprised of economists, engineers, energy experts, forest ecologists, agricultural scientists, and climate system scientists who develop the model and apply it to a range of science and policy questions and work closely with Earth system and ecosystem modelers to integrate the human decision components of GCAM into their analyses.\n\nGCAM is a dynamic-recursive model with technology-rich representations of the economy, energy sector, land use and water linked to a climate model that can be used to explore climate change mitigation policies including carbon taxes, carbon trading, regulations and accelerated deployment of energy technology. Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions drive the energy and land-use systems employing numerous technology options to produce, transform, and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover. Using a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 at 5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to explore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and the greenhouse gas consequences of specific policy measures or energy technology adoption including; CO2 capture and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen systems, nuclear energy, renewable energy technology, and energy use technology in buildings, industry and the transportation sectors. GCAM is an Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-class model. This means it can be used to simulate scenarios, policies, and emission targets from various sources including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Output includes projections of future energy supply and demand and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, radiative forcing and climate effects of 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree resolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology, and climate mitigation policy.\n\nCalvin, K., Patel, P., Clarke, L., Asrar, G., Bond-Lamberty, B., Cui, R.

VIC documentation can be read on the .\n\nThe Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (MHM) has been developed over the last two decades at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in collaboration with a large number of other researchers around the globe. Development and maintenance of the official version of the VIC model is currently coordinated by the Hydrologic Science and Engineering Group in the Environmental Energy Technologies Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. All development activity is coordinated via the Gitter Room, where you can also find all archived, current, beta, and development versions of the model.\n\nA skeletal first version of the VIC model was introduced to the community by R. Dickinson and a greatly expanded version, from which current variations evolved, is described by Elder et al. As compared to other MHMs, VIC’s distinguishing hydrological features are its representation of subgrid variability in soil storage capacity as a spatial probability distribution to which surface runoff is related, and its parameterization of base flow, which occurs from a lower soil moisture zone as a nonlinear recession. Movement of moisture between the soil layers is modeled as gravity drainage, with the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity a function of the degree of saturation of the soil. Spatial variability in soil properties, at scales smaller than the grid scale, is represented statistically, without assigning infiltration parameters to specific subgrid locations. Over time, many additional features and representations of physical processes have been added to the model. VIC has been used in a large number of regional and continental scale (even global) hydrological studies. In 2016, VIC version 5 was released. This was a major update to the VIC source code focusing mainly on infrastructure improvements. The development of VIC-5 is detailed in Elder et al. A selection of VIC applications can be found on the .\n\nEvery new application addresses new problems and conditions that the model may not currently be able to handle, and as such the model is always under development. The VIC model is an open source development project, which means that contributions are welcome, including to the VIC documentation.\n\nBy placing the original source code archive on GitHub, we hope to encourage a more collaborative development environment. A tutorial on how to use the VIC git repository and how to contribute your changes to the VIC model can be found on the . The most stable version of the model is in the `master` branch, while beta versions of releases under development can be obtained from the `development` branch of this repository.\n\nVIC is a research model developed by graduate students, post-docs and research scientists over a long period of time (since the early 1990s). Every new VIC application addresses new problems and conditions which the model may not currently be able to handle. As a result, the model is always under development. Because of the incremental nature of this development, not all sections of the code are equally mature and not every combination of model options has been exhaustively tested or is guaranteed to work. While you are more than welcome to use VIC in your own research endeavors, the model code comes with no guarantees, expressed or implied, as to suitability, completeness, accuracy, and whatever other claim you would like to make. In addition, the model has no graphical user interface, nor does it include a large set of analysis tools, since most people want to use their own set of tools.\n\nWhile we would like to hear about your particular application (especially a copy of any published paper), we cannot give you individual support in setting up and running the model. The VIC Users Email List includes reasonably complete instructions on how to run the model, as well as the opportunity to sign up for the VIC Users Email List. The Gitter Room should be used for questions about model setup and application. It is basically VIC users helping other VIC users. All other exchanges about VIC source code are managed through the Gitter Room.\n\nIf you make use of this model, please acknowledge the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory plus any other references appropriate to the features you used that are cited in the Elder et al. paper.\""

Analyze the following README content and extract ONLY 10 COMPLETE single or a maximum of two-word high-impact keywords based on the instructions: \"The main objective of this tutorial is to transfer knowledge in practical applications and management of statistical tools commonly used to explore meteorological time series, focusing on applications to study issues related with climate variability and climate change. This tutorial starts with some basic statistics for time series analysis, such as estimation of means, anomalies, standard deviation, correlations, arriving at the estimation of particular climate indexes (Niño 3), detrending single time series, and decomposition of time series. Filtering, interpolation of climate variables on regular or irregular grids, and leading modes of climate variability (EOF or HHT) are also covered. Additionally, the tutorial deals with different data formats such as CSV, NetCDF, Binary, and matlab's mat, etc. It is assumed that you have basic knowledge and understanding of statistics and Python.\n\nThe default Python library for dealing with large arrays of numeric data (e.g., four-dimensional latitude/longitude/altitude/time data arrays) is numpy, while the NetCDF data format is commonly used in Atmospheric science and Oceanography as it is convenient to store various variables of many dimensions. The default for reading and writing NetCDF files is netCDF4 (the capability to read and write text files, including .csv, is built into numpy).\n\nNetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. NetCDF was developed and is maintained at Unidata. Unidata provides data and software tools for use in geoscience education and research. The NetCDF homepage may be found at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/. The NetCDF source-code is hosted at GitHub, and may be found directly at http://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c.\n\nWe mainly use netCDF4-python, NumPy, and SciPy to process NetCDF and other data formats.\n\nnetCDF4-python\n> netcdf4-python is a Python interface to the netCDF C library. NetCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API is modeled after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that module (see more at http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/).\nNumPy\n> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python (see more at http://www.numpy.org/). It contains among other things:\n- a powerful N-dimensional array object\n- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\nBesides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\nSciPy\n> SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python (https://www.scipy.org/index.html). It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.\n> The additional benefit of basing SciPy on Python is that this also makes a powerful programming language available for use in developing sophisticated programs and specialized applications. Scientific applications using SciPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of the software landscape by developers across the world. Everything from parallel programming to web and database subroutines and classes have been made available to the Python programmer. All of this power is available in addition to the mathematical libraries in SciPy.\n\nWe will use the data publicly available as possible. The data are mainly downloaded from https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.derived.surfaceflux.html.\n\nMatplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.\nMatplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For a sampling, see the screenshots, thumbnail gallery, and examples directory.\nFor simple plotting the pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface, particularly when combined with IPython. For the power user, you have full control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc., via an object-oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.\nSee more from https://matplotlib.org/.\n\nBasemap is a great tool for creating maps using Python in a simple way. It’s a matplotlib extension, so it has got all its features to create data visualizations, and adds the geographical projections and some datasets to be able to plot coast lines, countries, and so on directly from the library.\nBasemap has got some documentation, but some things are a bit more difficult to find. I started this documentation to extend a little the original documentation and examples, but it grew a little, and now covers many of the basemap possibilities.\nSee more from https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n\nWe will mainly apply these mostly generic libraries to carry out data analysis step by step. The procedures or steps are common to the atmospheric and ocean sciences. Although other advanced libraries will simplify the procedures, the underlying ideas should be the same in essence.\nWe will also introduce more other libraries such as xarray and iris in the following parts.\""

We share these openly, so you can use it in your own project.\n\n- Does not load any images before they are actively requested by the user.\n- Minimizes the power consumption on the users device.\n- Adapts to reflect the amount of renewable energy it’s currently running on.\n- Informs the user of the impact of their browsing behavior.\n- Does not make use of videos.\n- Stores data locally on the user’s device to minimize data transfer.\n- Compresses all data to the greatest extent possible.\n- Loads only the most crucial programming scripts, frameworks and cookies.\n- Limits the amount of light emitted by the screen.\n- Optimizes and limits the use of custom fonts.\n\nThe Low Impact Website uses Shopify's  to fetch products and basic ecommerce functionality. It uses the .\n\nTo get started, you first need to install , and then run `yarn install`.\n\nTo setup your environment variables, you should copy the `.env.example` file and rename it `.env`. Then you must fill it out with your own Shopify setup. Organic Basics uses 4 different production Shopify shops and 1 for development, so we have defined 5 Apollo clients in `nuxt.config.js`: _eur_, _gbp_, _usd_, _dkk_ and _dev_. These 5 different configs are used to navigate between different currencies, and thus Shopify shops. This happens via the `_locale` part of the Nuxt routing, e.g. . You might not need 5 different shops, and so you must adapt the `nuxt.config.js` and `.env` files. We also use Contentful to display some content on the product pages. To fetch this, you must fill in `.contentful.json` with your own values. To start the development server at `localhost:3000`, run `yarn dev`. To build for production, run `yarn build`. To launch the server and the production build, run `yarn start`. For a more detailed explanation on how things work, check out . The Low Impact Website code is highly customized to the Organic Basics' website setup, and will more than likely not easily transfer to your setup. Thus the main outcomes of making this code available to the public will likely be in sharing learnings and techniques, instead of providing a plug-and-play solution for low impact websites.

The monetary and emissions impacts of that adoption are then calculated.  The framework and methodology for the model was developed by a core research team at Project Drawdown with senior research fellows and visiting researchers from each of the relevant solution domains, over the course of a number of years. The models were originally constructed in some ~80 Excel files.\n\nThis repository is a conversion of the original Excel models into python.  This includes both the analytical parts of the model, and the summary data used to produce key results.\nOur goal is to enable:\n   ongoing research by Project Drawdown and other researchers\n   use of this research in other projects, including a broader audience of policy makers, business leaders, and other interested parties.\nFuture updates to the research will be published in this repository.\n\nWhilst this repo covers the model and analytics in the form of a python library, our  develops that into a server-based solution and a researcher-aimed UI.\n\n\n\nConversion Status:\n  Almost all of the solutions (technologies) have been converted.\n  New solutions are converted as they become released from Project Drawdown research.\n  Core calculations (used to generate the core results) are completed\n  Most of the \"secondary calculations\" (which are used to do solution-specific generation of, e.g. emissions factors or adoption estimates) are _not_ yet implemented.\n  The overall integration between multiple solution models (used to model, for example, the impact of adopton of one solution on demand for another) is work in progress.\n\nOther work in progress:\n  Continuing work to make the interfaces more accessible to folks outside the Project Drawdown community, both in terms of code improvements and documentation.\n\nFor a more detailed list, see the .\n\n--You can \nusing the `Fork` button at the top of the screen.

It provides reference workflows for understanding how AI models capture the physics of the Earth's atmosphere and how they can work with traditional numerical weather forecasting models. For instance, the repo provides a uniform interface for running inference using pre-trained model checkpoints and scoring the skill of such models using certain standard metrics. This repository is meant to facilitate the weather and climate community to come up with good reference baseline of events to test the models against and to use with a variety of data sources.\n\nEarth-2 MIP will be installable on PyPi upon general release. In the mean time, one can install from source:\n\nSee for more details and other options.\n\nEarth-2 MIP provides a set of examples which can be viewed on the page which can be used to get started with various workflows. These examples can be downloaded both as Jupyer Notebooks and Python scripts. The source Python scripts can be found in the folders.\n\nEarth-2 MIP provides high-level APIs for running inference with AI models. For example, the following can be used to run Pangu weather using an initial state from the climate data store (CDS):\n\nAnd you can get ACC/RMSE like this:\n\nThese notebooks illustrate how-to-use with a few models and this can serve as reference to bring in your own checkpoint as long as it's compatible. There may be additional work to make it compatible with Earth-2 MIP. Earth-2 MIP leverages the model zoo in to provide a reference set of base-line models. The goal is to enable the community to grow this collection of models as shown in the table below.\n\n| ID | Model | Architecture | Type | Reference | Source | Size |\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------------------------------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|:-------:|:---:|\n| fcn | FourCastNet | Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator  | global weather |    |  | 300Mb |\n| dlwp |  Deep Learning Weather Prediction  |  Convolutional Encoder-Decoder | global weather |      |  |  50Mb |\n| pangu | Pangu Weather (Hierarchical 6 24 hr)  |  Vision Transformer | global weather |   | onnx | 2Gb |\n| pangu_6 | Pangu Weather 6hr Model  |  Vision Transformer | global weather |   | onnx | 1Gb |\n| pangu_24 | Pangu Weather 24hr Model |  Vision Transformer | global weather |   | onnx | 1Gb |\n| fcnv2_sm |  FourCastNet v2 | Spherical Harmonics Fourier Neural Operator | global weather |    |  | 3.5Gb |\n| graphcast |  Graphcast, 37 levels, 0.25 deg | Graph neural network | global weather |    |  | 145MB |\n| graphcast_small |  Graphcast, 13 levels, 1 deg | Graph neural network | global weather |    |  | 144MB |\n| graphcast_operational |  Graphcast, 13 levels, 0.25 deg| Graph neural network | global weather |    |  | 144MB |\n| precipitation_afno | FourCastNet Precipitation | Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator  | diagnostic |    |  | 300Mb |\n| climatenet | ClimateNet Segmentation Model | Convolutional Neural Network | diagnostic |    |  | 2Mb |\n\nSome models require additional dependencies not installed by default. Refer to the for details.\n\n*Note: Each model checkpoint may have its own unique license. We encourage users to familiarize themselves with each to understand implications for their particular use case.\n\nWe want to integrate your model into the scoreboard to show the community! The best way to do this is via . You can contribute your model (both the training code as well as model checkpoint) and we can ensure that it is maintained as part of the reference set.\n\nEarth-2 MIP is an open source collaboration and its success is rooted in community contribution to further the field. Thank you for contributing to the project so others can build on your contribution. For guidance on making a contribution to Earth-2 MIP, please refer to the .\n\nThis work is inspired to facilitate similar engagements between teams here at NVIDIA the ML experts developing new models and the domain experts in Climate science evaluating the skill of such models. For instance, often necessary input data such as normalization constants and hyperparameter values are not packaged alongside the model weights. Every model typically implements a slightly different interface. Scoring routines are specific to the model being scored and may not be consistent across groups.\n\nEarth-2 MIP addresses these challenges and bridges the gap between the domain experts who most often are assessing ML models, and the ML experts producing them. Compared to other projects in this space, Earth-2 MIP focuses on scoring models on-the-fly. It has python APIs suitable for rapid iteration in a jupyter book, CLIs for scoring models distributed over many GPUs, and a flexible plugin framework that allows anyone to use their own ML models. More importantly Earth-2 MIP aspires to facilitate exploration and collaboration within the climate research community to evaluate the potential of AI models in climate and weather simulations.\n\nPlease see the for in depth information about Earth-2 MIP, functionality, APIs, etc.\n\nDiscuss new ideas, model integration, support etc.\n\nBug reports, feature requests, install issues, etc.\n\nEarth-2 MIP is provided under the Apache License 2.0, please see for full license text.\""

Fossil fuels represent 67 percent, nuclear 11 percent, and renewable energy sources just over 24 percent (and growing) of total worldwide electricity generation.\n\n**Solutions:** In the last few years, the competitiveness of renewable sources for electricity generation has continued to increase due to the price evolution and the efficiency improvements of these technologies.\n\n**SunCulture** provides a pay-as-you-go solar home system in Africa with eight hours of emission-free lighting each day and enough power to charge mobile phones.\n\n**Solar Aid** is helping farmers in rural Benin irrigate dry land.\n\n**African Energy Exchange (AEE)** provides a peer-to-peer electricity trading network for rural households with and without solar home systems in Shariatpur, Bangladesh. People in rural Bangladesh are now earning additional income by selling their surplus electricity while new users have gained access to electricity without a centralized grid.\n\n**RoofScore** leverages high-resolution aerial imagery from Google Earth to help calculate a roof's solar energy potential. It enables tens of millions of potential solar customers from across the U.S. to evaluate if their home is suitable for solar and how much they could save on electricity.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\n**Crop and livestock production** is the source of about **12 percent of all emissions**.\n\n**Land clearing (which is mostly for agriculture)** is the source of **another 12 percent of all emissions**.\n\n**Solutions:** Supply-side agricultural solutions (e.g. precision agriculture) reduce emissions from farming. Demand-side solutions (e.g. plant-based diet and reduced food waste) reduce the need for land clearing.\n\n**FarmWise** enables data-driven farming by leveraging local sensors, drones and satellite images and AI to create heatmaps for farmers to optimize their crop production.\n\n**FoodShare** is a free foodsharing web platform, allowing participants to share food and reduce food waste.\n\n**African Farmers' Union (AFU)** collects, analyzes and sends out agricultural advisories, crop and livestock market information and weather data to Ugandan farmers, who are among the most affected by the impacts of climate change. As a result, farmers are able to minimize crop loss and damage, making them more resilient to global warming.\n\n**RuralTech** in Colombia and Honduras leverages sensors and tools that collects, collates, and analyzes weather data to inform farmers in advance on how to adjust their agricultural practices to ensure maximum crop-yield and thus food security.\n\n**Deforestation and Degradation of Forest Ecosystems**\n\n**Deforestation and degradation of forest ecosystems** are responsible for about **10-15 percent of all emissions** today.\n\n**Solutions:** Land use solutions reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation of ecosystems.\n\n**Global Forest Watch** provides AI-powered conservation tools for deforestation analysis and forecasting.\n\n**Acoustic Monitoring Systems** creates acoustic monitoring systems to detect and end illegal deforestation in real-time.\n\n**Timberland** is a platform powered by blockchain technology, allowing anyone to invest in timberland.\n\n**Planet** leverages its satellite system and landcover classification algorithms to detect deforestation.\n\n**Green Sense** uses machine learning to monitor the progress in new green areas.\n\n**MangroveAction** combines cloud, machine-to-machine and mobile broadband to help the local community in Selangor, Malaysia, to better manage the growth of new mangrove saplings.\n\n**Urban Human Settlements**\n\n**Dense urban human settlement** accounts for a significant percentage of human energy use, mostly for heating and cooling, responsible for **6 percent of all emissions**.\n\n**Solutions:** Addressing the operating inefficiencies of dwelling in and using buildings, and of living in cities.\n\n**Zerohaus** is a concept house in Switzerland that is off-grid and produces its own energy.\n\n**CitySolutions** investigates sustainable solutions for city planning.\n\n**Transport**\n\n**Transport** produces **14 percent of all emissions**.\n\n**Solutions:** Some modes of transport can only currently be made more efficient at using existing fossil fuels, others have alternative fuels and/or can be avoided completely using information and communication technologies.\n\n**Volkswagen** is one of the world's most valuable car producers. It pioneered consumer-friendly electric cars, disrupting the diesel-powered traditional car industry.\n\n**ChargePoint** is the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) charging network. Its smart-energy management solutions help people and businesses shift from fueling with gasoline to fueling with electricity.\n\n**Green Infrastructure** provides a pay-as-you-go solar home system in Africa with eight hours of emission-free lighting each day and enough power to charge mobile phones.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\n**Linear Life Cycle** where material is extracted, processed, transported, manufactured, utilized, and discarded leaves a terrific atmospheric and financial footprint from the energy wasted.\n\n**Solutions:** Redesigning and reimagining the materials used in products and structures, as well as the means by which they can be reduced, reused, and recycled.\n\n**EcoChain** is making “fair” phones, opening up the supply chain and seeking to make a positive impact in the industries involved like mining, design, and manufacturing.\n\n**Green Life** from the Korean Ministry of Environment encourages users to make low-carbon lifestyle choices. More than 15 million cards have been issued in South Korea.\n\n**Solutions:** Technologies and solutions that do not yet have enough scientific and financial information to model, but that could emerge within the next several years as game-changers in the effort to reverse global warming.\n\n**Global Warming and Societal Impacts**\n\n**Global warming** already has societal impacts such as climate migrations and travel risks. Due to existing inequalities, women and girls are disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, from disease to natural disaster.\n\n**Solutions:** Analyze its societal impact to understand policy changes.\n\n**Moving People** uses 1.6 million historical aerial photographs to discern the effect of major droughts and climate change on human migration in Africa.\n\n**Sea Ice** is a climate change adaptation tool that integrates traditional knowledge of sea ice with advanced data acquisition and remote monitoring technology, aiding Inuits in the planning of safe routes on the ice, thus reducing travel risks.\n\n**Mont-Blanc Monitoring** leverages webcams, citizen science and automated the monitoring of temperatures, snow patterns, and behaviors of the fauna and flora in the Mont-Blanc area to inform on land-use strategies in the mountains.\n\n**Innovative Projects Need Funding**\n\nThis is a list of resources where hackers and devs can seek for it.\n\n**Microsoft Innovation Program** is an innovation program from Microsoft that supports sustainable projects with grants, PR and networking opportunities.\n\n**European Innovation and Technology** is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and identifies and supports innovation that helps society mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\n**Climate Nexus** supports startups that aspire to create a positive effect on climate issues.\n\n**CDM** requests and funds startups that concentrate on frontier technologies such as carbon removal.\n\n**Climate Finance** is an innovation program, supported by the UNFCCC, designed to accelerate disruptive and tangible climate solutions at scale.\n\n**Tech Climate Action** is a collective that aims at raising awareness in the tech community about the climate crisis.\n\n**License**\n\nTo the extent possible under law,  has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work.\""

At its core, it provides three main things:\n\nA catalog of 112398 geospatial climate, land cover, and soils\n    resources from 3477 collections. See (`climateR::catalog`)\n\nThis catalog is an [evolving, federated collection of\ndatasets](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR-catalogs) that can\nbe accessed by the data access utilities. This resource is rebuilt\nautomatically on a monthly cycle to ensure the data provided is\naccurate, while continuously growing based on user requests.\n\nA general [toolkit for accessing remote and local gridded\n    data](https://mikejohnson51.github.io/climateR/reference/index.html\n    files bounded by space, time, and variable constraints (`dap`,\n    `dap_crop`, `read_dap_file`)\n\nA set of\n    \n    that implement these methods for a core set of selected catalog\n    elements\n\n> :warning: **Python Users**: Data catalog access is available through\n> the USGS \n> package. Directly analogous climateR functionality can be found in\n> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples used here call upon the following shortcuts:\n\n`getGridMET` (OPeNDAP server, historic data)\n`getMODIS` (Authenticated OPeNDAP server)\n`getMACA` (OPeNDAP server, projection data)\n`getNLCD` (COG)\n`get3DEP` (VRT)\n`getCHIRPS` (erddap)\n\nWith the aim of highlighting the convenience of a consistent access\npatterns for a variety of data stores.\n\n\n\n`climateR` is designed with the same concepts as `AOI`. Namely, that all\nspatial data aggregation questions must start with an extent/area of\ninterest.\n\nBefore extracting any data, you must provide an. For the examples here,\nwe will use the state of Colorado (polygons), and all of its cities\n(points).\n\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n\nThe default behavior of `climateR` is to request data for the extent of\nthe AOI passed regardless of whether it is `POINT` or `POLYGON` data.\n\nThe *exceptionto the default behavior is if the the AOI is a single\npoint. To illustrate:\n\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n\nHowever since the extent of a POINT means `{xmax = xmin}` and\n`{ymax = ymin}`, climateR will return a time series of the intersecting\ncell, opposed to a one cell `SpatRaster`.\n\n\nAll `climateR` functions treat the extent of the AOI and the default\nextraction area. This allows multiple climateR shortcuts to be chained\ntogether using either the base R or dplyr piping syntax.\n\n\nUsing `extract_sites`, you can pass an existing data object. If no\nidentified column is provided to name the extracted timeseries, the\nfirst, fully unique column in the data.frame is used:\n\n\nWhile the default behavior is to extract data by **extent**, there are\ncases when the input AOI is a set of discrete units that you *wantto\nact as discrete units.\n\nA set of `POINT`s from which to extract time series\nA set of `POLYGON`s that data should be summarized to (mean, max, min,\n  etc.) (**WIP**)\n\nIn `climateR`, populating the `ID` parameter of any shortcut (or `dap`)\nfunction, triggers data to be extracted by unit.\n\n\nIn the `cities` object, the individual `POINT`s are uniquely identified\nby a `NAME` column. Tellings a climateR function, that `ID = \"NAME\"`\ntriggers it to return the summary:\n\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-15-1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n\nWhile climateR does not yet provide areal summaries, our intention is to\nintegrate the functionality from `zonal`.

It exploits the geophysical expressivity of many  (Climate & Forecast) metadata conventions, the flexible description of physical dimensions translated by , the network transparency of , the storage features (e.g., compression, chunking, groups) of  (the Hierarchical Data Format), and many powerful mathematical and statistical algorithms of  (the GNU Scientific Library). NCO is , , , and .\n\nWhat is NCO?\n-----------\nThe netCDF Operators (NCO) comprise a dozen standalone, command-line programs that take , , and/or  files as input, then operate (e.g., derive new data, compute statistics, print, hyperslab, manipulate metadata) and output the results to screen or files in text, binary, or netCDF formats. NCO aids analysis of gridded scientific data. The shell-command style of NCO allows users to manipulate and analyze files interactively, or with expressive scripts that avoid some overhead of higher-level programming environments.\n\nTraditional geoscience data analysis requires users to work with numerous flat (data in one level or namespace) files. In that paradigm instruments or models produce, and then repositories archive and distribute, and then researchers request and analyze, collections of flat files. NCO works well with that paradigm, yet it also embodies the necessary algorithms to transition geoscience data analysis from relying solely on traditional (or \"flat\") datasets to allowing newer hierarchical (or \"nested\") datasets.\n\nOperator | Full Name                  | Examples\n-------|:-------------------------| :---------| `ncap2` | netCDF Arithmetic Processor |  |\n`ncatted` | netCDF ATTribute EDitor   |  |\n`ncbo` | netCDF Binary Operator       |  |\n`ncclimo` | netCDF CLIMatOlogy Generator |  |\n`nces` | netCDF Ensemble Statistics   |  |\n`ncecat` | netCDF Ensemble conCATenator |  |\n`ncflint` | netCDF FiLe INTerpolator  |  |\n`ncks` | netCDF Kitchen Sink          |  |\n`ncpdq` | netCDF Permute Dimensions Quickly, Pack Data Quietly |  |\n`ncra` | netCDF Record Averager       |  |\n`ncrcat` | netCDF Record conCATenator |  |\n`ncremap` | netCDF REMAPer          |  |\n`ncrename` | netCDF RENAMEer          |  |\n`ncwa` | netCDF Weighted Averager     |  |\n\nThe NCO project points to mailing lists, discussion forums, and instructions to make contributing easy.

UXarray provides Xarray-styled functionality to better read in and use\nunstructured grid datasets that follow standard conventions, including UGRID,\nMPAS, ICON, SCRIP, ESMF, FESOM2, and Exodus grid formats. This effort is a result of the\ncollaboration between Project Raijin (NSF NCAR and Pennsylvania State University)\nand the SEATS Project (Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory). The UXarray team welcomes community\nmembers to become part of this collaboration at any level of contribution.\n\nUXarray is implemented in pure Python and does not explicitly contain or require\nany compiled code. This makes UXarray more accessible to the general Python\ncommunity. Any contributions to this repository in pure Python are welcome and\ndocumentation for contribution guidelines can be found when clicking `New Issue`\nunder the `Issues` tab in the UXarray repository.\n\n\n\nWe have created UXarray based on \n(via inheritance of Xarray Dataset and DataArray classes), a Pangeo ecosystem package\ncommonly-used for structured grids recognition, to support reading and\nrecognizing unstructured grid model outputs. We picked the name \"UXarray\"\n(pronounced \"you-ex-array\"), with the \"U\" representing unstructured grids.\n\n\n\n``Grid`` class for storing grid information and providing grid-specific functionality\n  Support for reading UGRID, MPAS, ESMF, ICON, GEOS-CS, SCRIP, and EXODUS grid formats\n  Support for reader structured (i.e. latitude longitude) grids\nExtension of xarray's ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` classe to support unstructured grid operations\n  ``uxarray.UxDataArray`` inherits ``xarray.DataArray`` and is attached to a ``Grid`` instance through the ``.uxgrid`` accessor\n  ``uxarray.UxDataset`` inherits ``xarray.Dataset`` and is attached to a ``Grid`` instance through the ``.uxgrid`` accessor\nExtension of xarray's ``open_dataset`` and ``open_mfdataset`` methods to support reading grid and data files\nPlotting\n  Native visualization of unstructured grids written using the ``hvPlot`` package\n  Support for grid topology visualization (i.e. exploring the geometry of a grid) and data visualization (i.e. data mapped to each face)\nSubsetting\n  Ability to select arbitrary regions of a grid using different selection methods (nearest neighbor, bounding circle, bounding box)\nRemapping\n  Support for nearest neighbor and inverse distance weighted unstructured to unstructured remapping\nTopological Aggregations\n  Perform aggregations within different topology elements using connectivity information\nMathematical Operators\n  Support for Integral, Difference, and Gradient calculations\n\n\n\n\nThe following intended features have been inspired by discussions with\nmembers of the scientific community, within the SEATS Project and Project\nRaijin, and on several community platforms such as [Xarray GitHub\nRepository](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4222). The UXarray team\nis receptive to additional functionality requests.\n\nSupport for finite volume and finite element outputs.\nTriangular decompositions.\nCalculation of supermeshes (consisting of grid lines from two input grids).\nSnapshots and composites following particular features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you to all of our contributors!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to cite our work, please follow [How to cite\nUXarray](https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/citation.html).\n\n\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/\"><img src=\"docs/_static/images/logos/NSF_logo.png\" alt=\"NSF Logo\" width=\"400\"/></a></td>\n    <td>Project Raijin, entitled \"Collaborative Research: EarthCube Capabilities: Raijin: Community Geoscience Analysis Tools for Unstructured Mesh Data\", was awarded by NSF 21-515 EarthCube (Award Number (FAIN): 2126458) on 08/19/The award period of performance has a start date of 09/01/2021 and end date of 08/31/2024.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science\"><img src=\"docs/_static/images/logos/DOE_vertical.png\" alt=\"DOE Logo\" width=\"1200\"/></a></td>\n    <td>SEATS is funded by the Regional and Global Modeling and Analysis (RGMA) program area in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program which is part of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in DOE’s Office of Science.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://www.earthcube.org/\"><img src=\"docs/_static/images/logos/EarthCube_logo.png\" alt=\"EarthCube Logo\" width=\"300\"/></a></td>\n    <td><a href=\"https://www.earthcube.org/\">EarthCube</a> aims to transform the conduct of geosciences research by developing and maintaining a well-connected and facile environment that improves access, sharing, visualization, and analysis of data and related resources.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://pangeo.io/\"><img src=\"docs/_static/images/logos/PANGEO_logo.png\" alt=\"PANGEO Logo\" width=\"400\"/></a></td>\n    <td><a href=\"https://pangeo.io/\">Pangeo</a> supports collaborative efforts to develop software and infrastructure to enable Big Data geoscience research.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n[github-ci-badge]: https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n[github-ci-link]: https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n[codecov-badge]: https://codecov.io/github/UXARRAY/uxarray/graph/badge.svg?token=lPxJeGNxE0\n[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/github/UXARRAY/uxarray\n[rtd-badge]: https://readthedocs.org/projects/uxarray/badge/?version=latest\n[rtd-link]: https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/uxarray.svg\n[pypi-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uxarray/\n[conda-badge]: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/uxarray\n[conda-link]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/uxarray\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/UXARRAY/uxarray\n[asv-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/benchmarked%20by-asv-green.svg?style=flat\n[asv-link]: https://uxarray.github.io/uxarray-asv/\n[doi-badge]: https://zenodo.org/badge/421447986.svg\n[doi-link]: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/421447986\n[repo-link]: https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray\""

If run concentration-driven, emissions are back-calculated. Custom GHGs and SLCFs can be defined, and all components are optional allowing experiments such as pulse-response analyses to single forcers or gathering up non-CO~2~ species as an aggregate forcing.\n\nThe examples directory contains Jupyter notebooks with some simple examples showing how to run FaIR and the standalone energy balance model.\n\nIf you want to try this out online, [go here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/master?filepath=examples/basic_run_example.ipynb).\n\nFaIR is naive. It will run whatever climate scenario and climate configuration you give it. If you violate the laws of physics, FaIR won't stop you. For simple climate models as for complex, garbage in leads to garbage out. More subtle to spot are those analyses with simple climate models where the present day warming (or historical) is wrong or the climate is warming too slowly or too quickly. At least, plot a historical temperature reconstruction over your results and see if it looks right.\n\nWe have produced IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 consistent probabilistic ensembles to run with. The calibration data can be obtained . These parameter sets are calibrated to CMIP6 models, run in a large Monte Carlo ensemble, and constrained based on observed and assessed climate metrics. For an example of how to use this calibration data set with SSP emissions, see [this example](https://docs.fairmodel.net/en/latest/examples/calibrated_constrained_ensemble.html).

It considers ensemble members as a basic dimension of the data structures. Moreover, `climate4R` is transparently (and remotely) connected to the Santander Climate Data Gateway, offering several state-of-the-art datasets (including CMIP5 and CORDEX subsets).\n\n`climate4R` is formed by the following four core packages (all in GitHub): `accessR`, `processR`, `unitsR` and `visR`. These packages are fully documented in the corresponding GitHub wikis.\n\n`climate4R` capabilities are further extended by providing support to physical units handling (`unitsR`) and geoprocessing tasks (`visR`).   \n\nCompatibility with some external packages has been achieved by wrapping packages, thus enhancing `climate4R` with new functionalities (e.g. ETCCDI extreme climate indices via the `extremesR` package). \n\nSemantic provenance (metadata) information for `climate4R` products can be generated using `provenanceR` via the `spatialR` package.\n\nand `climate4R` installations available. The `metaR` file also includes the `RJAGS` framework. This is the base layer for the **climate4R Hub*(a cloud-based computing facility to run `climate4R` notebooks at ).\n\n<!-An schematic illustration of the different components of `climate4R` is given in the following figure:\n-->\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/man/figures/climate4R_2.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\nThe **formal reference*of `climate4R` is: \n\n***M.

Therefore, the recommended installation is through the conda package below, which ensures the proper installation of all dependencies.\n\n\n\n is a free minimal installer for conda. The `conda` installs an up-to-date version of the different packages composing the `climate4R` framework, along with the associated library dependencies (udunits, openjdk, netcdf Java etc.), avoiding potential problems like the R-java configuration etc. Note that the appropriate miniconda distribution must be installed (go to the ) before running the following commands. We recommend starting from a clean environment (named climate4R in this example):\n\n\n\nIn this environment, install `climate4R` by issuing:\n\n\n\nActivate the conda environment to work with climate4R. Deactivate the environment with:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual packages can be installed directly from the github sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case a particular paper notebook is to be replicated, the installation of specific version tags can be done by just explicitly indicating the tag number in the repo name. For example:\n\n\ninstalls the `visualizeR` package version used in Frías _et al._ 2018, while the following\n\n\nwill install a more recent version of the package used in the paper by Iturbide _et al._ Examples of use of the `climate4R` framework are given in the reference papers above. In the following we illustrate the main functionalities of `climate4R` with a simple example, consisting on **calculating an ETCCDI index (Summer Days) from bias corrected EURO-CORDEX data over Southern Europe.*More details at the  document in the `man` folder and full code at the companion .\n\n<img src=\"/man/figures/climate4r_example.png\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" />\n\n\n**Please note that the pool of people who can provide support for `climate4R` packages is very small and our time for support is limited.

Basics of climate field analysis are covered, with some forays into exploratory techniques associated with climate scenarios design. The package is aimed to ease the typical steps of analysis climate models outputs and gridded datasets (support for weather stations is a work-in-progress).\n\nClimateTools.jl is registered on METADATA.jl and can be added and updated with `Pkg` commands. See  for detailed installation instructions and Python's dependencies (for mapping features).\n\nClimate indices and bias correction functions are coded to leverage the use of multiple threads. To gain maximum performance, use `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=n`, where _n_ is the number of threads. To get an idea of the number of threads you can use type `Sys.THREADS`. This is especially useful for bias correction.\n\nIf you'd like to have other climate indices coded, please, submit them through a Pull Request! I'd be more than happy to include them.

More in-depth documentation is provided in the official documentation (Links: /).The entry point of `ClimateTools` is to load data with the `load` function. Optional polygon clipping feature is available. By providing such polygon, the `load` function  returns a `ClimGrid` with grid points contained in the polygon.\n\n`load` returns a `ClimGrid` type. Using the optional `poly` argument, the user can provide a polygon and the returned `ClimGrid` will only contains the grid points inside the provided polygon. For some variable, the optional keyword argument `data_units` can be provided. For example, precipitation in climate models are usually provided as `kg/m^2/s`. By specifying `data_units = mm`, the `load` function returns accumulation at the data time resolution. Similarly, the user can provide `Celsius` as `data_units` and `load` will return `Celsius` instead of `Kelvin`.\n\nThe `ClimGrid` is a in-memory representation of a CF-compliant netCDF file for a single variable.\n\nFurther subsets can be done in the temporal and spatial domains. `spatialsubset` function acts on `ClimGrid` type and subset the data using a user polygon. The function returns another `ClimGrid`.\n\nTemporal subset of the data is done with `temporalsubset` function, which returns a continuous timeserie between `startdate` and `enddate`.\n\nResampling is available with the `resample`, which returns a given period for each year (e.g. only summer months).\n\nMapping climate information can be done by using `mapclimgrid`.\n\nWhich should return the time average of ClimGrid `C` over the world region.\n\nNote that if the `ClimGrid` data structure has 3 dimensions (time x longitude x latitude) the `mapclimgrid` function makes a time-average (i.e. climatological mean). Right now, there are a growing list of hardcoded regions (see help section of `mapclimgrid` function) and the default `auto` which use the maximum and minimum of the lat-long coordinates inside the `ClimGrid` structure. The user can also provide a polygon(s) and the `mapclimgrid` function will clip the grid points outside the specified polygon. Another option is to provide a mask (with dimensions identical to the spatial dimension of the `ClimGrid` data) which contains `NaN` and `1.0` and the data inside the `ClimGrid` struct will be clipped with the mask. Other regions will be added in the future, as well as the option to send a custom region defined by a lat-lon box.\n\nMore than 20 climate indices are available in the package, such as the annual number of tropical nights, annual maximum and minimum, etc. You can calculate such indices simply with:\n\nWhich returns another `ClimGrid`. You can also map this `ClimGrid` with the `mapclimgrid` function and returns the climatological mean of the annual maximum (e.g. daily precipitation in the example below). From the figure, we clearly sees the monsoon regions (India) and region with wind-driven precipitations (e.g. western sides of the oceans).\n\nA list of indices can be found in the documentation and in the `functions.jl` source code.\n\nNote that if the `ClimGrid` data structure has 3 dimensions (time x longitude x latitude) the `mapclimgrid` function makes a time-average (i.e. climatological mean).

It is intended for visualization or as a 1st step before bias-correcting the `ClimGrid` dataset.\n\nThe following command will interpolate the data contained in `ClimGrid A` into the coordinates of `ClimGrid B` and returns a new `ClimGrid C` which contains the interpolated data of `A` into the grid of `B`.\n\nIt is also possible to interpolate a `ClimGrid` onto specified longitude and latitude vectors.\n\nSee  .\n\nSometimes, the timeseries are split among multiple files (e.g. climate models outputs). To obtain the complete timeseries, you can `merge` 2 `ClimGrid`. The method is based on the merging of two `AxisArrays` and is overloaded for the `ClimGrid` type.\n\nIt is possible to export to a netCDF file with the command `write`\n\nDashboard tool.

This can be a single entity or a list of entities. At least one between `heater` and `cooler` has to be defined.\ncooler |  | *Conditional| Switch that will activate/deactivate the cooling system.  This can be a single entity or a list of entities. At least one between `heater` and `cooler` has to be defined.\nactual_temp_sensor |  | *Required| Sensor of actual room temperature.\nmin_temp | 5 | Optional | Minimum temperature manually selectable.\nmax_temp | 40 | Optional | Maximum temperature manually selectable.\ntarget_temp_sensor |  | *Required| Sensor that represent the desired temperature for the room. Suggestion: use my [`file_restore`][1] component or something similar.\ntolerance | 0.5 | Optional | Tolerance for turn on and off the switches mode.\ninitial_hvac_mode | `heat_cool`, `heat`, `cool`, `off` | Optional | If not set, components will restore old state after restart. I suggest not to use it.\nrelated_climate |  | Optional | To be used if the climate object is a slave of another one. below 'Related climate' chapter a description.\nhvac_options | 7 | Optional | This defines which combination of manual-auto-off options you want to activate. Refer to the chapter below for the value.\nauto_mode | `all`, `heating`, `cooling` | Optional | This allows limiting the heating/cooling function with HVAC mode HEAT_COOL.\nmin_cycle_duration |  | Optional | TIMEDELTA type. This will allow protecting devices that request a minimum type of work/rest before changing status. On this, you have to define hours, minutes and/or seconds as son elements.\n\n\n`target_temp_sensor` is the Home Assistant `entity_id` of a sensor which' state change accordingly a specified temperature profile. This temperature profile should describe the desired temperature for the room each day/hour.\n`target_temp_sensor` must have a temperature value (a number with or without decimal) as a state.\n\nSuggestion: use my [`file_restore`][1] custom components.\n\n\nThe programmed temperature will change accordingly to the one set by the `target_temp_sensor` when in `heat_cool` mode. You can still change it temporarily with the slider. Target temperature will be set, again, to the one of `target_temp_sensor` at its first change.\n`heat` and `cool` modes are the manual mode; in this mode, the planning will not be followed.\n\nAfter a restart of Home Assistant, room temperature and planned room temperature will match till `actual_temp_sensor` will return a temperature value.\nThis is done to avoid possible issues with Homekit support with a temperature sensor that needs some time to sync with Home Assistant.\n\n\nThis field is used if the climate-to-climate objects are related to each other, for example, if they use the same heater.\nSet this field with the `entity_id` with a different climate object and this will prevent the heater/cooler to be turned off by the slavery climate if the master one is active.\n\nFor example, I have two climate objects, one for the room and one for the boiler.\nThe boiler's climate is used to prevent freezing and, if the temperature is lower than the programmed one, the room heater is turned on.\nThis means that, if the room's heater is on and the boiler's heater is off, the boiler will turn off the heater despite the room climate demands heat.\nWith this `master_climate` field this unwanted turn-off will not happen.\n\nNote: my suggestion is to set it to both climates that are related to each other.\n\n\nThis parameter allows you to define which mode you want to activate for that climate object. This is a number with a meaning of every single bit. Here below the table.\n\nbit3 AUTOMATIC | bit2 MANUAL | bit1 OFF | RESULT | Meaning\n--| --| --| --| --0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Noting active USELESS\n0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | OFF only\n0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | MANUAL only, you will have only `heat` and/or `cool` modes\n0 | 1 | 1 | 3 | MANUAL and OFF\n1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | AUTOMATIC only, you will have only `heat_cool` modes\n1 | 0 | 1 | 5 | AUTOMATIC and OFF\n1 | 1 | 0 | 6 | AUTOMATIC and MANUAL\n1 | 1 | 1 | 7 | DEAFAULT Full mode, you will have active all the options.\n\n\nFrom version 7.6 you will be able to set `heaters` and `coolers` to the same list and you'll get the correct way of work in manual mode.\nThis means that `heat` and `cool` mode will work correctly with the same list, but `heat_cool` mode will not (otherwise you will not be able to switch the real device between the 2 modes).\nMy suggestion is to set `hvac_options: 3` to remove the auto mode.\n\n\nThis component has been developed for the bigger project of building a smart thermostat using Home Assistant and way cheaper than the commercial ones.\nYou can find more info on that [here][3]\n\nEverything is available through HACS.\n\nIcons made by <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik\" title=\"Freepik\">Freepik</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\"> www.flaticon.com</a>\n\n![logo][2]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.file_restore\n[2]: https://github.com/MapoDan/home-assistant/blob/master/mapodanlogo.png\n[3]: https://github.com/MapoDan/home-assistant\""

You can run it on the command line using the Code Climate CLI or on our [hosted analysis platform][codeclimate].\n\n\n\nThe duplication engine's algorithm can be surprising, but it's actually very simple. We have a [docs page][what-is-duplication] explaining the algorithm.\n\n\n\nInstall the [Code Climate CLI][cli], if you haven't already.\nYou're ready to analyze! `cd` into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`. Duplication analysis is enabled by default, so you don't need to do anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe set useful threshold defaults for the languages we support but you may want to adjust these settings based on your project guidelines.\n\nThe mass threshold configuration represents the minimum \"mass\" a code block must have to be analyzed for duplication. If the engine is too easily reporting duplication, try raising the threshold. If you suspect that the engine isn't catching enough duplication, try lowering the threshold. The best setting tends to differ from language to language.\n\nTo adjust this setting, use the top-level `checks` key in your config file:\n\n\n\nNote that you have the update the YAML structure under the `languages` key to the Hash type to support extra configuration.\n\n\n\nBy default, the duplication engine will report code that has been duplicated in just two locations. You can be less strict by only raising a warning if code is duplicated in three or more locations only. To adjust this setting, add a `count_threshold` key to your config. For instance, to use the default `mass_threshold` for ruby, but to enforce the [Rule of Three][rule-of-three], you could use this configuration:\n\n\n\nYou can also change the default `count_threshold` for all languages:\n\n\n\n\n\nAll engines check only appropriate files but you can override default set of patterns. Patterns are ran against the project root directory so you have to use `**` to match files in nested directories. Also note that you have to specify all patterns, not only the one you want to add.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the Duplication engine will use a Python 2 parser. To enable analysis for Python 3 code, specify the `python_version` as shown in the example below. This will enable a Python 3 parser and add the `.py3` file extension to the list of included file patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes structural similarities are reported that you just don't care about. For example, the contents of arrays or hashes might have similar structures and there's little you can do to refactor them. You can specify language specific filters to ignore any issues that match the pattern. Here is an example that filters simple hashes and arrays:\n\n\n\nThe syntax for patterns are pretty simple. In the first pattern:\n`\"(hash (lit _) (str _) ___)\"` specifies \"A hash with a literal key, a \""

Phenix.phaser expects a \"real\" bfactor, where (lower = better). See  from Claudia Millán.\nWhat is the maximum length?\n  Limits depends on free GPU provided by Google-Colab `fingers-crossed`\n  For GPU: `Tesla T4` or `Tesla P100` with ~16G the max length is ~2000\n  For GPU: `Tesla K80` with ~12G the max length is ~1000\n  To check what GPU you got, open a new code cell and type `!nvidia-smi`\nIs it okay to use the MMseqs2 MSA server (`cf.run_mmseqs2`) on a local computer?\n  You can access the server from a local computer if you queries are serial from a single IP. Please do not use multiple computers to query the server.\nWhere can I download the databases used by ColabFold?\n  The databases are available at \nI want to render my own images of the predicted structures, how do I color by pLDDT?\n  In pymol for AlphaFold structures: `spectrum b, red_yellow_green_cyan_blue, minimum=50, maximum=90`\n  If you want to use AlphaFold Colours (credit: Konstantin Korotkov)\n    \n  In pymol for RoseTTAFold structures: `spectrum b, red_yellow_green_cyan_blue, minimum=0.5, maximum=0.9`\nWhat is the difference between the AlphaFold2_advanced and AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 (_batch) notebook for complex prediction?\n  We currently have two different ways to predict protein complexes: (1) using the AlphaFold2 model with residue index jump and (2) using the AlphaFold2-multimer model. AlphaFold2_advanced supports (1) and AlphaFold2_mmseqs2 (_batch) (2).\nWhat is the difference between localcolabfold and the pip installable colabfold_batch?\n  is an installer script designed to make ColabFold functionality available on local users' machines. It supports wide range of operating systems, such as Windows 10 or later (using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2), macOS, and Linux.\nIs there a way to amber-relax structures without having to rerun alphafold/colabfold from scratch?\n  Yes, see this .\nWhere can I find the old notebooks that were previously developed and are now retired?\n  You can find the list of retired notebooks in the  wiki page.\nWhere can I find the history of MSA Server Databases used in ColabFold?\n  You can view the database version history on the  wiki page.\n\n\nFor instructions on how to install ColabFold locally refer to  or see our  on how to run ColabFold within Docker.\n\n\n\nWhen you pass a FASTA or CSV file containing your sequences to `colabfold_batch` it will automatically query the public MSA server to generate MSAs. You might want to split this into two steps for better GPU resource utilization:\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst create a directory for the databases on a disk with sufficient storage (940GB (!)). Depending on where you are, this will take a couple of hours:\n\nNote:  is used to create the databases and perform sequece search in the ColabFold MSA server. Please use this version if you want to obtain the same MSAs as the server.\n\n\n\nIf MMseqs2 is not installed in your `PATH`, add `--mmseqs <path to mmseqs>` to your `mmseqs` in `colabfold_search`:\n\n\n\nThis will create intermediate folder `msas` that contains all input multiple sequence alignments formated as a3m files and a `predictions` folder with all predicted pdb,json and png files.\n\nThe procedure above disables MMseqs2 preindexing of the various ColabFold databases by setting the `MMSEQS_NO_INDEX=1` environment variable before calling the database setup script. For most use-cases of `colabfold_search` precomputing the index is not required and might hurt search speed. The precomputed index is necessary for fast response times of the ColabFold server, where the whole database is permamently kept in memory. In any case the batch searches will require a machine with about 128GB RAM or, if the databases are to be kept permamently in RAM, with over 1TB RAM.\n\nIn some cases using precomputed database can still be useful. For the following cases, call the `setup_databases.sh` script without the `MMSEQS_NO_INDEX` environment variable:\n\n(0) As mentioned above, if you want to set-up a server.\n\n(1) If the precomputed index is stored on a very fast storage system (e.g., NVMe-SSDs) it might be faster to read the index from disk than computing in on the fly.  In this case, the search should be performed on the same machine that called `setup_databases.sh` since the precomputed index is created to fit within the given main memory size. Additionaly, pass the `--db-load-mode 0` option to make sure the database is read once from the storage system before use.\n\n(2) Fast single query searches require the full index (the `.idx` files) to be kept in memory. This can be done with e.g. by using . Thus, this type of search requires a machine with at least 768GB to 1TB RAM for the ColabfoldDB. If the index is present in memory, use the `--db-load-mode 2` parameter in `colabfold_search` to avoid index loading overhead.\n\nIf no index was created (`MMSEQS_NO_INDEX=1` was set), then `--db-load-mode` does not do anything and can be ignored.\n\n\nColabFold Tutorial presented at the Boston Protein Design and Modeling Club.  .\n\n\n\nby Yoshitaka Moriwaki\nby Richard John Wheeler\nby Pablo R.

Currently available versions of pre-trained weights are as follows:\n\n* trained in the same way as BioBERT-Base v1.1 but includes LM head, which can be useful for probing (available in PyTorch)\n* based on BERT-large-Cased (custom 30k vocabulary), \n* based on BERT-base-Cased (same vocabulary), \n* based on BERT-base-Cased (same vocabulary), \n* based on BERT-base-Cased (same vocabulary), \n* based on BERT-base-Cased (same vocabulary), \n\nNote that the performances of v1.0 and v1.1 base models (BioBERT-Base v1.0, BioBERT-Base v1.1) are reported in the paper.\nAlternately, you can download pre-trained weights from \n\nSections below describe the installation and the fine-tuning process of BioBERT based on Tensorflow 1 (python version <= 3.7). For PyTorch version of BioBERT, you can check out . If you are not familiar with coding and just want to recognize biomedical entities in your text using BioBERT, please use  which uses BioBERT for multi-type NER and normalization.\n\nTo fine-tune BioBERT, you need to download the . After downloading the pre-trained weights, use `requirements.txt` to install BioBERT as follows:\n\nNote that this repository is based on the by Google. All the fine-tuning experiments were conducted on a single TITAN Xp GPU machine which has 12GB of RAM. You might want to install `java` to use the official evaluation script of BioASQ. See `requirements.txt` for other details.\n\nLink | Detail\n------------| ------------| PyTorch-based BioBERT implementation\n | Web-based biomedical NER normalization using BioBERT\n | Advanced version of BERN (web-based biomedical NER) w/ NER from BioLM NEN from PubMedBERT\n | BioBERT based real-time question answering model for COVID-19\n | Code for the seventh BioASQ challenge winning model (factoid/yesno/list)\n | Paper link with  (Bioinformatics)\n\nWe provide a pre-processed version of benchmark datasets for each task as follows:\n****: (17.3 MB), 8 datasets on biomedical named entity recognition\n****: (2.5 MB), 2 datasets on biomedical relation extraction\n****: (5.23 MB), 3 datasets on biomedical question answering task.\n\nYou can simply run `download.sh` to download all the datasets at once. This will download the datasets under the folder `datasets`. Due to the copyright issue of other datasets, we provide links of those datasets instead: ****, ****.\n\nAfter downloading one of the pre-trained weights, unpack it to any directory you want, and we will denote this as `$BIOBERT_DIR`. For instance, when using BioBERT-Base v1.1 (PubMed 1M), set `BIOBERT_DIR` environment variable as:\n\nLet `$NER_DIR` indicate a folder for a single NER dataset which contains `train_dev.tsv`, `train.tsv`, `devel.tsv` and `test.tsv`. Also, set `$OUTPUT_DIR` as a directory for NER outputs (trained models, test predictions, etc). For example, when fine-tuning on the NCBI disease corpus, following command runs fine-tuning code on NER with default arguments:\n\nYou can change the arguments as you want. Once you have trained your model, you can use it in inference mode by using `--do_train=false --do_predict=true` for evaluating `test.tsv`. The token-level evaluation result will be printed as stdout format. For example, the result for NCBI-disease dataset will be like this:\n\n(tips : You should go up a few lines to find the result. It comes before `INFO:tensorflow:***Trainable Variables ****` )\n\nNote that this result is the token-level evaluation measure while the official evaluation should use the entity-level evaluation measure. The results of `python run_ner.py` will be recorded as two files: `token_test.txt` and `label_test.txt` in `$OUTPUT_DIR`. Use `./biocodes/ner_detokenize.py` to obtain word level prediction file. This will generate `NER_result_conll.txt` in `$OUTPUT_DIR`. Use `./biocodes/conlleval.pl` for entity-level exact match evaluation results.\n\nThe entity-level results for the NCBI disease corpus will be like:\n\nNote that this is a sample run of an NER model. The performance of NER models usually converges at more than 50 epochs (learning rate = 1e-5 is recommended).\n\nLet `$RE_DIR` indicate a folder for a single RE dataset, `$TASK_NAME` denote the name of task (two possible options: {gad, euadr}), and `$OUTPUT_DIR` denote a directory for RE outputs:\n\nFollowing command runs fine-tuning code on RE with default arguments. The predictions will be saved into a file called `test_results.tsv` in the `$OUTPUT_DIR`. Use `./biocodes/re_eval.py` for the evaluation. Note that the CHEMPROT dataset is a multi-class classification dataset and to evaluate the CHEMPROT result, you should run `re_eval.py` with additional `--task=chemprot` flag. The result for GAD dataset will be like this:\n\nPlease be aware that you have to change `$OUTPUT_DIR` to train/test a new model. For instance, as most RE datasets are in 10-fold, you have to make a different output directory to train/test a model for a different fold (e.g., `$ export OUTPUT_DIR=./re_outputs_2`).\n\nTo use the BioASQ dataset, you need to register in the which authorizes the use of the dataset. Please unpack the pre-processed BioASQ dataset provided above to a directory `$QA_DIR`. For example, with `$OUTPUT_DIR` for QA outputs, set as: Files named as `BioASQ-*.json` are used for training and testing the model which are the pre-processed format for BioBERT. Note that we pre-trained our model on SQuAD dataset to get state-of-the-art performance (see  to get BioBERT pre-trained on SQuAD), and you might have to change `$BIOBERT_DIR` accordingly. Following command runs fine-tuning code on QA with default arguments. The predictions will be saved into a file called `predictions.json` and `nbest_predictions.json` in `$OUTPUT_DIR`. Run `./biocodes/transform_nbset2bioasqform.py` to convert `nbest_predictions.json` to the BioASQ JSON format, which will be used for the official evaluation. This will generate `BioASQform_BioASQ-answer.json` in `$OUTPUT_DIR`. Clone ***from BioASQ github and run evaluation code on `Evaluation-Measures` directory. Please note that you should always put 5 as parameter for -e.\n\nAs our model is only on factoid questions, the result will be like, where the second, third and fourth numbers will be SAcc, LAcc, and MRR of factoid questions respectively.

When you need to run many commandline programs that depend on each other in complex ways, SciPipe helps by making the process of running these programs flexible, robust and reproducible. SciPipe also lets you restart an interrupted run without over-writing already produced output and produces an audit report of what was run, among many other things. SciPipe is built on the proven principles of Flow-Based Programming (FBP) to achieve maximum flexibility, productivity and agility when designing workflows. Compared to plain dataflow, FBP provides the benefits that processes are fully self-contained, so that a library of re-usable components can be created, and plugged into new workflows ad-hoc. Similar to other FBP systems, SciPipe workflows can be likened to a network of assembly lines in a factory, where items (files) are flowing through a network of conveyor belts, stopping at different independently running stations (processes) for processing. SciPipe was initially created for problems in bioinformatics and cheminformatics, but works equally well for any problem involving pipelines of commandline applications. Project status: SciPipe pretty stable now, and only very minor API changes might still occur. We have successfully used SciPipe in a handful of both real and experimental projects, and it has had occasional use outside the research group as well. There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow design. See the for details. There is not (yet) support for the . For full installation instructions, see the . For quick getting started steps, you can do: Go Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the trailing dots!), and create a Go module for your script: Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in SciPipe looks like: To create a file with a similar simple example, you can run: Let's put the code in a file named hello_world.go and run it. First you need to make sure that the dependencies (SciPipe in this case) is installed in your local Go module. This you can do with: Then you can go ahead and run the workflow: Let's check what file SciPipe has generated: As you can see, it has created a file hello.out.txt, and hello.out.world.out.txt, and an accompanying .audit.json for each of these files. Now, let's check the output of the final resulting file: Now we can rejoice that it contains the text \"Hello World\", exactly as a proper Hello World example should :) Now, these were a little long and cumbersome filenames, weren't they? SciPipe gives you very good control over how to name your files, if you don't want to rely on the automatic file naming. For example, we could set the first filename to a static one, and then use the first name as a basis for the file name for the second process, like so: In the {i:in... part, we are re-using the file path from the file received on the in-port named 'in', and then running a Bash-style trim-from-end command on it to remove the .txt extension. Now, if we run this, the file names get a little cleaner: Finally, we could have a look at one of those audit file created: Each such audit-file contains a hierarchic JSON-representation of the full workflow path that was executed in order to produce this file. On the first level is the command that directly produced the corresponding file, and then, indexed by their filenames, under \"Upstream\", there is a similar chunk describing how all of its input files were generated. This process will be repeated in a recursive way for large workflows, so that, for each file generated by the workflow, there is always a full, hierarchic, history of all the commands run with their associated metadata to produce that file. You can find many more examples in the in the GitHub repo. For more information about how to write workflows using SciPipe, and much more, see ! See , presented at the . See . The architecture of SciPipe is based on an like pattern in pure Go presented in and blog posts on Gopher Academy.

We organize TDC into three distinct *problems*. For each problem, we give a collection of *learning tasks*. Finally, for each task, we provide a series of *datasets*.\n\nIn the first tier, after observing a large set of therapeutics tasks, we categorize and abstract out three major areas (i.e., problems) where machine learning can facilitate scientific advances, namely, single-instance prediction, multi-instance prediction, and generation:\n\nSingle-instance prediction `single_pred`: Prediction of property given individual biomedical entity.\nMulti-instance prediction `multi_pred`: Prediction of property given multiple biomedical entities. \nGeneration `generation`: Generation of new desirable biomedical entities.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mims-harvard/TDC/master/fig/tdc_problems.png\" alt=\"problems\" width=\"500px\" /></p>\n\nThe second tier in the TDC structure is organized into learning tasks. Improvement in these tasks can result in numerous applications, including identifying personalized combinatorial therapies, designing novel classes of antibodies, improving disease diagnosis, and finding new cures for emerging diseases.\n\nFinally, in the third tier of TDC, each task is instantiated via multiple datasets. For each dataset, we provide several splits of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to simulate the type of understanding and generalization (e.g., the model's ability to generalize to entirely unseen compounds or to granularly resolve patient response to a polytherapy) needed for transition into production and clinical implementation.\n\nTDC provides a collection of workflows with intuitive, high-level APIs for both beginners and experts to create machine learning models in Python. Building off the modularized \"Problem - Learning Task - Data Set\" structure (see above) in TDC, we provide a three-layer API to access any learning task and dataset. This hierarchical API design allows us to easily incorporate new tasks and datasets.\n\nFor a concrete example, to obtain the HIA dataset from the ADME therapeutic learning task in the single-instance prediction problem:\n\nYou can see all the datasets that belong to a task as follows:\n\nSee all therapeutic tasks and datasets on the !\n\nTo retrieve the training/validation/test dataset split, you could simply type on the website for details.\n\nWe provide various evaluation metrics for the tasks in TDC, which are described in on the website.

ADAM uses a set of schemas to describe genomic sequences, reads, variants/genotypes, and features, and can be used with data in legacy genomic file formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM, BED/GFF3/GTF, and VCF, as well as data stored in the columnar format. On a single node, ADAM provides competitive performance to optimized multi-threaded tools, while enabling scale out to clusters with more than a thousand cores. ADAM's APIs can be used from Scala, Java, Python, R, and SQL.\n\nOver the last decade, DNA and RNA sequencing has evolved from an expensive, labor intensive method to a cheap commodity. The consequence of this is generation of massive amounts of genomic and transcriptomic data. Typically, tools to process and interpret these data are developed with a focus on excellence of the results generated, not on scalability and interoperability. A typical sequencing workflow consists of a suite of tools from quality control, mapping, mapped read preprocessing, to variant calling or quantification, depending on the application at hand. Concretely, this usually means that such a workflow is implemented as tools glued together by scripts or workflow descriptions, with data written to files at each step. This approach entails three main bottlenecks:\n\n  Scaling the workflow comes down to scaling each of the individual tools,\n  the stability of the workflow heavily depends on the consistency of intermediate file formats, and\n  writing to and reading from disk is a major slow-down.\n\nWe propose here a transformative solution for these problems, by replacing ad-hoc workflows by the , developed in the ecosystem.\n\nADAM enables the high performance in-memory cluster computing functionality of Apache Spark on genomic data, ensuring efficient and fault-tolerant distribution based on data parallelism, without the intermediate disk operations required in traditional distributed approaches.\n\nFurthermore, the ADAM and Apache Spark approach comes with an additional benefit. Typically, the endpoint of a sequencing pipeline is a file with processed data for a single sample: e.g. variants for DNA sequencing, read counts for RNA sequencing, etc. The real endpoint, however, of a sequencing experiment initiated by an investigator is interpretation of these data in a certain context. This usually translates into (statistical) analysis of multiple samples, connection with (clinical) metadata, and interactive visualization, using data science tools such as R, Python, Tableau and Spotfire. In addition to scalable distributed processing, Apache Spark also allows interactive data analysis in the form of analysis notebooks (Spark Notebook, Jupyter, or Zeppelin), or direct connection to the data in R and Python.\n\nADAM is available in Conda via Bioconda, https://bioconda.github.io\n\nADAM is available in Homebrew via Brewsci/bio, https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-bio\n\nADAM is available in Docker via BioContainers, https://biocontainers.pro\n\nFind `{tag}` on the tag search page, https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/adam?tab=tags\n\nYou will need to have version 3.3.9 or later installed in order to build ADAM.\n\nYou'll need to have a Spark release on your system and the `$SPARK_HOME` environment variable pointing at it; prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the .\n\nAs of ADAM version 0.37.0, Spark version 3.2.0 or later is required.\n\nADAM's documentation is available at http://adam.readthedocs.io.\n\nADAM's core API documentation is available at http://javadoc.io/doc/org.bdgenomics.adam/adam-core-spark3_2.ADAM builds upon the open source , , and [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) projects. Additionally, ADAM can be deployed for both interactive and production workflows using a variety of platforms.\n\nThere are a number of tools built using ADAM's core APIs:\n\nAvocado is a distributed variant caller built on top of ADAM for germline and somatic calling.\nADAM API wrappers for bioinformatics tools, (e.g., , , )\nDECA is a reimplementation of the XHMM copy number variant caller on top of ADAM.\nGnocchi provides primitives for running GWAS/eQTL tests on large genotype/phenotype datasets using ADAM.\nLime provides a parallel implementation of genomic set theoretic primitives using the ADAM API.\nMango is a library for visualizing large scale genomics data with interactive latencies.\n\nFor more, please see our  that extend ADAM.\n\nThe best way to reach the ADAM team is to post in our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/bigdatagenomics/adam) or to open an issue on our .

For researchers familiar with Unix this README will probably be sufficient.\n\n\n1) All essential GWAS QC steps along with scripts for data visualization.\n2) Dealing with population stratification, using 1000 genomes as a reference.\n3) Association analyses of GWAS data.\n4) Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses.\n\nThe scripts downloadable from this GitHub page can be seen purely as tutorials and used for educational purposes, but can also be used as a template for analyzing your own data.\nAll scripts/tutorials from this GitHub page use freely downloadable data, commands to download the necessary data can be found in the scripts. \n\n\n1_QC_GWAS.zip\n2_Population_stratification.zip\n3_Association_GWAS\n4_ PRS.doc\n  \nHow to use the tutorials on this page:\nThe tutorials are designed to run on an UNIX/Linux computer/server. The first 3 tutorials contain both *.text as *.R scripts. The main scripts for performing these tutorials are the *.text scripts (respectively for the first 3 tutorials: 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS, 2_Main_script_MDS.txt, and 3_Main_script_association_GWAS.txt). These script will execute the *.R scripts, when those are placed in the same directory. \nNote, without placing all files belonging to a specific tutorial in the same directory the tutorials cannot be completed. \nFurthermore, the first 3 tutorials are not independent; they should be followed in the order given above, according to their number. For example, the files generated at the end of tutorial 1 are essential in performing tutorial Therefore, those files should be moved/copied to the directory in which tutorial 2 is executed. In addition, the files from tutorial 2 are essential for tutorial The fourth tutorial (4_ PRS.doc) is a MS Word document, and runs independently of the previous 3 tutorials.\n\nAll scripts are developed for UNIX/Linux computer resources, and all commands should be typed/pasted at the shell prompt.\n\nNote:\nThe *.zip files contain multiple files, in order to successfully complete the tutorials it is essential to download all files from the *.zip files and upload them to your working directory.\nTo pull all tutorials to your computer simply use the following command: git clone https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial.git . Alternatively, you can manually open the *.zip folders and PRS.doc file by clicking on the folder/file followed by clicking on \"View Raw\".\n\n\nPlease email Andries Marees (a.t.marees@vu.nl) for questions\n\n\nOnce you completed the current tutorial we recommend you to visit https://github.com/AngelaMinaVargas/eMAGMA-tutorial\nThis Github repository guides the steps to use eMAGMA.  \neMAGMA is a post-GWAS analysis, that conducts eQTL informed gene-based tests by assigning SNPs to tissue-specific eGenes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Step-by-step-guide for researches new to Unix and/or genetic analyses. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe tutorial consist of four separate parts. The first three are dependent of each other and can only be performed in consecutive order, starting from the first (1_QC_GWAS.zip), then the second (2_Population_stratification.zip, followed by the third (3_Association_GWAS). The fourth part (4_ PRS.doc) can be performed independently. \n\nThe Unix commands provided in this guide should be typed/copy-and-pasted after the prompt ($ or >) on your Unix machine. Note, the \">\" in front of the commands should not be copy-and-pasted. Only what comes after the \">\".\n\nWe assume that you have read the accompanying article \"A tutorial on conducting Genome-Wide-Association Studies: Quality control and statistical analysis\n\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484742), which should provide you with a basic theoretical understanding of the type of analyses covered in this tutorial. \n\nThis step-by-step guide serves researchers who have none or very little experience with Unix, by helping them through the Unix commands in preparation of the tutorial. \n\n\n\nStep 1) The current set of tutorials on this GitHub page are based on a GNU/Linux-based computer, therefore: \nMake sure you have access to a GNU/Linux-based computer resource.\nCreate a directory where you plan to conduct the analysis.\n\n> mkdir {name_for_your_directory}\n<br />\n\nStep 2) Download the files from the GitHub page \nChange the directory of your Unix machine to the created directory from step > cd HOME/{user}/{path/name_for_your_directory}  \n> git clone https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial.git\n\nUnzip the folder of the first tutorial and move into the newly created directory.\n\n> unzip 1_QC_GWAS.zip\n> cd 1_QC_GWAS\n<br />\n\nStep 3) This tutorial requires the open-source programming language R and the open-source whole genome association analysis toolset PLINK version 1.07 (all commands also work with PLINK2). If these programs are not already installed on your computer they can be downloaded from respectively:\nhttps://www.r-project.org/\nhttp://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/\nhttps://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2\n\nWe recommend using the newest versions. These websites will guide you through the installation process.\n\nCongratulations everything is set up to start the tutorial!\n\n\n\n\nStep 4) Once you've created a directory in which you have downloaded and unzipped the folder: 1_QC_GWAS.zip, you are ready to start the first part of the actual tutorial.\nAll steps of this tutorial will be excecuted using the commands from the main script: 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS.txt, the only thing necessary in completing the tutorial is copy-and-paste the commands from the main script at the prompt of your Unix device. Note, make sure you are in the directory containing all files, which is the directory after the last command of step There is no need to open the other files manually. \n\nThere are two ways to use the main script:  \n\nIf you are a novice user, we recommend opening 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS.txt in WordPad or Notepad on your Windows computer.\n\n\nAlternatively, 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS.txt can be opened using an Unix text editor, for example vi.\n\n> vi 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS.txt\nThis enables you to read the script within the Unix environment and copy the command lines from it.\n\n> :q\n\nFrom there, using either option 1 or 2, you can read the information given at every step of script “, 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS.txt” and copy-paste the commands after the prompt on your Unix machine. \n\nNote, if R or PLINK are installed in a directory other than your working directory please specify the path to the excecutables in the given script. Alternatively, you can copy the executables of the programs to your working directory. For example, by using:\ncp {path/program name} {path/directiory}. However, when using a cluster computer, commands such a \"module load plink\", and \"module load R\" will suffice, regardless of directory.\n\nFor more information of using R and PLINK in a Unix/Linux environment we refer to:\nhttp://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml\n\n\n\n\nUnzip the tutorial folder of choice as described in step Use the output file from the last tutorial as input for the tutorial you want to start.\n\n> cp {path/directory/file} {path/directory}\n\nUse 2_Main_script_MDS.txt for the second tutorial and 3_Main_script_association_GWAS.txt for the third tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n4_ PRS.doc works independently from the other tutorials. After downloading 4_ PRS.doc, you can run the script, without the need for unzipping, in a directory of choice.\""

In addition, Nucleus enables painless integration with the TensorFlow machine learning framework, as anywhere a genomics file is consumed or produced, a TensorFlow tfrecords file may be used instead.\n\nPlease check out our tutorial on\n. It's a Python notebook that really demonstrates the power of Nucleus at integrating information from multiple file types (BAM, VCF and Fasta) and turning it into a form usable by TensorFlow.\n\nWhich of these would most increase your usage of Nucleus?

Simply type\n\nThis will call `build_clif.sh`, which will build CLIF from scratch as well.\n\nFor all other systems, you will need to first install CLIF by following the instructions at before running install.sh. You'll need to run this command with Python 3. If you don't want to build CLIF binaries on your own, you can consider using pre-built CLIF binaries (see ). Note that we don't plan to update these pre-built CLIF binaries, so we recommend building CLIF binaries from scratch.\n\nNote that install.sh extensively depends on apt-get, so it is unlikely to run without extensive modifications on non-Debian-based systems.\n\nNucleus depends on TensorFlow. By default, install.sh will install a CPU-only version of a stable TensorFlow release (currently 2.6). If that isn't what you want, there are several other options that can be enabled with a simple edit to `install.sh`.\n\nRunning `install.sh` will build all of Nucleus's programs and libraries.

The language strives to be accessible and understandable to all manner of users, including programmers, analysts, and operators of a production system. \n\nThe language enables common patterns, such as scatter-gather and conditional execution, to be expressed simply. WDL is designed for portability, and there are several implementations to choose from that run in a variety of environments, including HPC systems and cloud platforms.\n\nWDL versioning follows semantic conventions. The WDL language has a two-number version (e.g., `1.2`). An increase in the minor (second) version number (e.g., `1.1` to `1.2`) indicates the addition of, or non-breaking changes to, the language or standard library functions. An increase in the major (first) version number (e.g., `1.0` to `2.0`) indicates that breaking changes have been made.\n\nThe WDL specification has a three-number version (e.g., `1.2.0`). The specification version tracks the language version, but there may also be patch releases (indicated by a change to the patch, or third, version number) that include fixes for typos, additional examples, or non-breaking clarifications of ambiguous language.\n\nThe WDL specification contains all relevant information for users and developers, including those wanting to implement an execution engine. This GitHub project uses the branch for the current version of the specification as its primary branch, so you will always see the current version of the specification so long as you visit this project's repository. Users are strongly encouraged to use the current version of the specification unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThis branch is for version 1.2 of the specification. All development of new non-breaking features should be done against this branch.\n\nPrevious versions of the spec can be found here:\n\nThere are a number of draft versions that correspond to initial efforts at creating WDL. While these are functional specifications, they should not be considered feature complete, and they contain many bugs and irregularities.\n\nThe next major version of the specification is 2.0. All development of new breaking features should be done against that branch.\n\nThe WDL community depends on your involvement to thrive. You are encouraged to ask questions, help other users, and make contributions where you can. Interactions occur primarily on Stack Overflow and Discord. The WDL community also has an official Google Group where announcements are made.\n\nSearch in the Stack Overflow to see if the question has been asked already; if not, start a new discussion. Join our Discord and ask in the `#general` channel. Search the Discord for previously answered questions, or ask a new question. Search the Discord for previously answered questions. This group is largely inactive, so you're encouraged to ask new questions in one of the above places instead.\n\nSearch for an existing issue. If your issue has not already been reported, create a new one. For feature requests, you are encouraged to first start a discussion at one of the places listed above to get feedback from the community. If you'd like to provide a fix/implementation for an issue, please read about contributing before submitting a pull request.\n\nprovided by Terra (a product of the Broad Institute)\n\nThe following are collections of open-source WDL workflows. The WDL task or workflow you need may already be available in one of these repositories, or you may find a similar workflow and customize it to your needs. (requires registration)\n\nWDL does not have an official implementation. Third parties are relied upon to provide installable software or hosted platforms that interpret and execute WDL workflows and tasks. Although WDL does not yet have an official compliance program or certification process, implementers are expected to design their tools according to the specification so as to maximize the portability of workflows across implementations. Nonetheless, implementers may provide additional optional features specific.

WDL-Tooling is a standalone Java tool for WDL parsing, validating, linting, and diagramming. WDL-Java provides 1) a parser Java/Scala library, based on the ANTLR grammars, for WDL draft-2, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0; and 2) command-line tools for syntax checking, type-checking, linting, code formatting (including upgrading from older to newer WDL versions), generating documentation, and executing WDL tasks locally.

WDL-Tests is a collection of test cases for WDL implementations. A specification is provided for writing new tests that are compatible with automated testing frameworks. MiniWDL-Tester is an implementation-agnostic workflow tester. It can be used with both Cromwell and MiniWDL. Uses pytest as the underlying test framework. Tests can be specified in either YAML format or python code. WDL-Tester is a plugin for the pytest unit testing framework that enables testing of WDL tasks and workflows. Tests can be specified in either YAML format or python code.\n\nwdl-zip generates a ZIP file including a given WDL source code file and any other WDL files it imports. The ZIP file can be supplied directly to miniwdl run, which can extract it automatically. wdl-package packages a workflow and all of its imports into a zip file. The zip can be used as an imports zip package for cromwell. The utility can add non-WDL files (such as the license) to the zip package and provides options to package the zip in a binary reproducible way.\n\nWDL only advances through community contributions. While participating in discussions and submitting issues are great ways to be involved, help is also needed to implement changes to the specification. For more information on how you can contribute, please read the contributing guide.\n\nSubmitted pull requests are subject to the WDL license. Please review and familiarize yourself with the process if you would like to see changes submitted to the specification.\n\nThe WDL specification is entirely community driven; however, it is overseen by the WDL Governance Committee. If you are interested in being involved in WDL governance, please join the WDL Governance Committee and post a message in the `#governance` channel.\""

Salmon achieves its accuracy and speed via a number of different innovations, including the use of *selective-alignment(accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments), and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely into many different pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use of our *selective-alignmentalgorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an **unsorted*BAM file with alignments to the transcriptome produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same **wicked**-fast, state-of-the-art inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment.\n\nGive salmon a try! You can find the latest binary releases .\n\nThe current version number of the master branch of Salmon can be found \n\nDocumentation\n==============\n\nThe documentation for Salmon is available on , check it out .\n\nSalmon is, and will continue to be, .\nIf you need industrial-grade technical support, please consider the options at .\n\nDecoy sequences in transcriptomes\n=================================\n\ntl;dr: fast is good but fast and accurate is better!\n, and accounting for the . To this end, salmon provides the ability to index both the transcriptome as well as decoy seuqence that can be considered during mapping and quantification. The decoy sequence accounts for reads that might otherwise be (spuriously) attributed to some annotated transcript. This provides a step-by-step guide on how to efficiently index the reference transcriptome and genome to produce a decoy-aware index. Specifically, there are 3 possible ways in which the salmon index can be created:\n\ncDNA-only index : salmon_index https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/getting_started/. This method will result in the smallest index and require the least resources to build, but will be the most prone to possible spurious alignments.\n\nSA mashmap index: salmon_partial_sa_index (regions of genome that have high sequence similarity to the transcriptome) Details can be found in  and using . While running mashmap can require considerable resources, the resulting decoy files are fairly small. This will result in an index bigger than the cDNA-only index, but still mucch smaller than the full genome index below. It will confer many, though not all, of the benefits of using the entire genome as a decoy sequence.\n\nSAF genome index: salmon_sa_index (the full genome is used as decoy) The tutorial for creating such an index can be found . This will result in the largest index, but likely does the best job in avoiding spurious alignments to annotated transcripts.\n\n**Facing problems with Indexing?**, Check if anyone else already had this problem in the issues section or fill the index generation \n\n\nIf you are generating an index to be used for single-cell or single-nucleus quantification with , then we recommend you consider building a spliced+intron (_splici_) reference. This serves much of the purpose of a decoy-aware index when quantifying with alevin-fry, while also providing the capability to attribute splicing status to mapped fragments. More details about the _splici_ reference and the Unspliced/Spliced/Ambiguous quantification mode it enables can be found .\n\nChat live about Salmon\n======================\n\nYou can chat with the Salmon developers and other users via Gitter (**Note**: Gitter is much less frequently monitored than GitHub, so if you have an important problem or question, please consider opening an issue here on GitHub)!\""

It is a task agnostic framework that combines the explicit knowledge of a Knowledge Graph (KG) with the implicit knowledge of a Large Language Model (LLM). Here is the  of the work.\n\nHere, we utilize a massive biomedical KG called  as the provider for the biomedical context. SPOKE has incorporated over 40 biomedical knowledge repositories from diverse domains, each focusing on biomedical concept like genes, proteins, drugs, compounds, diseases, and their established connections. SPOKE consists of more than 27 million nodes of 21 different types and 53 million edges of 55 types.\n\nThe main feature of KG-RAG is that it extracts \"prompt-aware context\" from SPOKE KG, which is defined as: the minimal context sufficient enough to respond to the user prompt. Hence, this framework empowers a general-purpose LLM by incorporating an optimized domain-specific 'prompt-aware context' from a biomedical KG.\n\nHere is news from FDA about the drug \"setmelanotide\" approved by FDA for weight management in patients with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.\n\n*Note: This example was run using KG-RAG v0.3.

We are actively working on improving its versatility.**\n\nClone this repository.

Having a common and controllable environment for running software could help to deal with some of the current problems during software development and distribution. BioContainers is a community-driven project that provides the infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage and distribute bioinformatics containers with a special focus on omics fields such as proteomics, genomics, trascriptomics and metabolomics. The main containers already implemented in BioContainers (https://github.com/BioContainers/containers) are discussed in detail, including examples on how to use BioContainers. \nThe currently available BioContainers containers facilitate the usage, and reproducibility of software and algorithms. They can be integrated into more comprehensive bioinformatics pipelines and different architectures (local desktop, Cloud environments or HPC clusters). We also present the  guidelines and specifications on how to create new containers, and how to contribute to the BioContainers project.\n\n\n\nProvide a base specification and images to easily build and deploy new bioinformatics/proteomics software\nincluding the source and examples.\n\nProvide a series of containers ready to be used by the bioinformatics community (https://github.com/BioContainers/containers).\n\nDefine a set of guidelines and specifications to build a standardized container that can be \nused in combination with other containers and bioinformatics tools.\n\nDefine a complete infrastructure to develop, deploy and test new bioinformatics containers\nusing continuous integration suites such as Travis Continuous Integration (https://travis-ci.org/), \nShippable (https://app.shippable.com/), or manually built solutions.\n\nProvide support and help to the bioinformatics community to deploy new containers for researchers that do not have bioinformatics support.\n\nProvide guidelines and help on how to create reproducible pipelines by defining, reusing\nand reporting specific container versions which will consistently produce the exact same\nresult and always be available in the history of the container.\n\nCoordinate and integrate developers and bioinformaticians to produce best practice of\ndocumentation and software development.\n\n\n------------Containers are build from existing operating systems. They are different from Virtual machines because they don't posses an entire guest OS inside, instead, containers are build using optimized system\nlibraries and use the host OS memory management and process controls. Containers normally are centralized around a specific software and you can make them executable by instantiating images from them.\n\n\n\nMost of the time when a bioinformatics analysis is performed, several bioinformatics tools and software should be installed and configure. This process can take several hours and demand a lot of efforts including the installation of multiple dependencies and tools. BioContainers provides ready to use packages and tools that can be easily deployed and used in local machines, HPC and cloud architectures. \n\n\n\nBioContainers are listed in two main registries: \n\n:  Docker-based containers that can use the docker infrastructure. \n: Dockerand rkt-based containers that can use the rkt infrastructure. \n\nFor a full documentation about how to use BioContainers to perform bioinformatics analysis, please check the  \n\n\nBioContainers is a community-driven project that allows bioinformatics to request, build and deploy bioinformatics tools using containers. The following figure presents the \ngeneral BioContainers workflow: \n\n\n\nThe next sections explain in detail the presented workflow: \n \n (i) How to request a workflow\n (ii) Use a BioContainer\n (iii) Developing containers \n\n\n\nBioconda packages automatically build a related container. If you are looking for a bioconda package container, check related package documentation, a container in quay.io should be available, see . Do not forget to use the needed tag version, no *latesttag is available.\n \nUsers can request a container by opening an issue in the  `(In the previous workflow this is the first step performed by user henrik)`. The issue \nshould contain the name of the software, the url of the code or binary to be package and information about the software . When the container \nis deployed and fully functional, the issue will be close by the developer or the contributor to BioContainers. \n  \n\n\nWhen a container is deployed and the developer closes the issue in GitHub, the user `(henrik)` receives a notification that the container is ready.\nThe user can then use  or  to pull or fetch the corresponding container. \n\n\nDeveloping containers\n----------------------There are two different ways to build a container.\n\nGo to the GitHub repository with the recipe of the software you want, clone it, and build it yourself on your machine.\nUse the docker daemon to search for a ready-to-use version of the containerized software you want.\n\nInside the central repository there is a list of softwares with docker recipes, there you can find more information about how to work with them.\n\n\n\nBioContainers are based on Linux systems, so you will need a computer with Linux installed. You also will need the `docker` or `rkt` daemon and the software you want to containerize.\n\n\n\nNow you need to create a Dockerfile. Dockerfiles are simple recipes to instruct the daemon on how to set an appropriate OS and how to download, manage, install and\ngive access to the software inside.\n\nYou can check the  documentation for more information.\n\nOnce the container is ready you can get in touch with us so we can make the appropriate arrangements to make your container available to everyone in the community by giving an automated build system.\n\n\n\nNow you need to create a rkt. rkt containers are simple recipes to instruct the daemon on how to set an appropriate OS and how to download, manage, install and\ngive access to the software inside.\n\nYou can check the  documentation for more information.\n\nOnce the container is ready you can get in touch with us so we can make the appropriate arrangements to make your container available to everyone in the community by giving an automated build system.\n\n\nSupport\n---------Whether you want to make your own software available to others as a container, use them on your pipelines and analysis or just give opinions, you are most welcome. This is a community-driven project, that means everyone has a voice.\n\nHere are some general ideas:\n\nBrowse our list of containers\nPropose your own ideas or software\nInteract with other if you think there is something missing.\""

It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.\n\nBowtie 2is available from various package managers, notably\n. With Bioconda installed, you\nshould be able to install Bowtie 2 with `conda install bowtie2`.\n\nContainerized versions of Bowtie 2 are also available via the\n project (e.g. via\n).\n\nYou can also download Bowtie 2 sources and binaries from the\n\"releases\" tab on this page. Binaries are available for the Linux,\nMac OS X, and Windows. By utilizing the \nBowtie 2 now supports the following architectures: ARM64, PPC64, and\ns390x.  If you plan to compile Bowtie 2 yourself, make sure you at least have\nthe  library and header files installed. See the\n\nsection of the manual for details.\n\nLooking to try out Bowtie 2? Check out the  (currently in beta).\n\nbowtie2 takes a Bowtie 2 index and a set of sequencing read files and outputs a\nset of alignments in SAM format.\n\n\"Alignment\" is the process by which we discover how and where the read sequences are\nsimilar to the reference sequence. An \"alignment\" is a result from this process,\nspecifically: an alignment is a way of \"lining up\" some or all of the characters in\nthe read with some characters from the reference in a way that reveals how they're\nsimilar. For example:\n\nWhere dash symbols represent gaps and vertical bars show where aligned characters match.\n\nWe use alignment to make an educated guess as to where a read originated with\nrespect to the reference genome. It's not always possible to determine this with\ncertainty. For instance, if the reference genome contains several long stretches of\nAs (`AAAAAAAAA` etc.) and the read sequence is a short stretch of As (`AAAAAAA`), we\ncannot know for certain exactly where in the sea of As the read originated.\n\nExamples*bowtie2-build builds a Bowtie index from a set of DNA sequences. `bowtie2-build`\noutputs a set of 6 files with suffixes `.1.bt2`, `.2.bt2`, `.3.bt2`, `.4.bt2`,\n`.rev.1.bt2`, and `.rev.2.bt2`. In the case of a large index these suffixes will\nhave a `bt2l` termination. These files together constitute the index: they are all\nthat is needed to align reads to that reference. The original sequence FASTA files\nare no longer used by Bowtie 2 once the index is built.\n\nBowtie 2's `.bt2` index format is different from Bowtie 1's `.ebwt` format, and they\nare not compatible with each other.\n\nExamples*bowtie2-inspect extracts information from a Bowtie 2 index about what kind of\nindex it is and what reference sequences were used to build it. When run without any\noptions, the tool will output a FASTA file containing the sequences of the original\nreferences (with all non-A/C/G/T characters converted to Ns). It can also be used to\nextract just the reference sequence names using the `-n/--names` option or a more\nverbose summary using the `-s/--summary` option.\n\nExamples*Langmead B, Wilks C., Antonescu V., Charles R. ____. . btyLangmead B, Salzberg S. ____. . 2012, 9:357-Langmead B, Trapnell C, Pop M, Salzberg SL. ____.  10:RP.

It also adds a few built-in functions and a command-line option to use TAB as the input/output delimiter. When the new functionality is not used, bioawk is intended to behave exactly the same as the original BWK awk.\n\nThe original awk requires a YACC-compatible parser generator (e.g., Byacc or Bison). Bioawk further depends on zlib so as to work with gzip'd files.\n\nUsing this option is equivalent to\n\n    bioawk -F'\\t' -v OFS=\"\\t\"\n\nThis option specifies the input format. When this option is in use, bioawk will seamlessly add variables that name the fields, based on either the format or the first line of the input, depending on *arg*. This option also enables bioawk to read gzip'd files. The argument *arg* may take the following values:\n\n- `help`: List the supported formats and the naming variables.\n- `hdr` or `header`: Name each column based on the first line in the input. Special characters in the first are converted to underscore. For example:\n\n        grep -v ^\n\n  prints the `CHROM` and `POS` columns of the input VCF file.\n\n- `sam`, `vcf`, `bed`, and `gff`: SAM, VCF, BED, and GFF formats.\n- `fastx`: This option regards a FASTA or FASTQ as a TAB-delimited file with four columns: sequence name, sequence, quality, and FASTA/Q comment, such that various fields can be retrieved with column names. See also example 4 in the following.\n\nSee `awk.1`.\n\nList the supported formats:\n\n        bioawk -c help\n\nExtract unmapped reads without header:\n\n        bioawk -c sam 'and($flag,4)' aln.sam.gz\n\nExtract mapped reads with header:\n\n        bioawk -Hc sam '!and($flag,4)'\n\nReverse complement FASTA:\n\n        bioawk -c fastx '{print \">\"$name;print revcomp($seq)}' seq.fa.gz\n\nCreate FASTA from SAM (uses revcomp if FLAG & 16)\n\n        samtools view aln.bam | \\\n            bioawk -c sam '{s=$seq; if(and($flag, 16)) {s=revcomp($seq)} print \">\"$qname\"\\n\"s}'\n\nPrint the genotypes of sample `foo` and `bar` from a VCF:\n\n        grep -v ^\n\nWhen option `-c` is in use, bioawk replaces the line reading module of awk. The new line reading function parses FASTA and FASTQ files and seamlessly reads gzip'ed files. However, the new code does not fully mimic the original code. It may fail in corner cases (though this has not happened yet). Thus, when `-c` is not specified, awk falls back to the original line reading code and does not support gzip'ed input.\n\nWhen `-c` is in use, several \""

Despite its popularity, I sadly don't have the time to give it the attention it deserves. Also, its codebase is too large and my C++/Qt skills are too rusty for me to make anything more than trivial changes.\n\nI'm not declaring Bandage completely abandoned, because I still think it's a useful tool, but don't expect a lot development or support on this repo. I will, however, strive to ensure that Bandage continues to run well on modern systems. E.g. I released  in January 2022, which compiles using modern versions of  and runs natively on Apple Silicon Macs.\n\nA number of enterprising users have , so if you’re after a specific new feature, you might find it implemented in one of the forks, the most active of which is .\n\nBandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly graphs made by de novoassemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT and others.\n\nDe novoassembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but also the connections between those contigs, which were previously not easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs, with connections, using graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth. Users can interact with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring nodes. Sequence information can also be extracted directly from the graph viewer. By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage opens up new possibilities for analysing and improving de novoassemblies that are not possible by looking at contigs alone.\n\nMore information and download links are on the Bandage website: rrwick.github.io/Bandage/\n\nBandage documentation is available on the Bandage GitHub wiki.\n\nBandage help tips are also built into the program. Throughout the UI, you will find these icons next to controls and settings: help text icon. Click them to see a description of that element of Bandage.\n\nCompiled 64-bit binaries for Ubuntu Linux, CentOS, macOS and Windows are available in the GitHub 'Releases' section and from the Bandage website.\n\nIf you download and run the Mac binary, you may receive a warning stating that Bandage 'can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer' or 'is damaged and can't be opened'. Right click on the file and select 'Open' to override this warning. If that doesn't work, clear the quarantine extended attribute via the command line with `xattr -cr Bandage.app`.\n\nThe Linux binaries come in two varieties: dynamically-linked and statically-linked. The dynamically-linked binary is preferable, but it has more dependencies (like Qt 5). If you experience problems with the dynamically-linked binary, please try the statically-linked version instead.\n\nIf the compiled binaries do not work for you, you can build Bandage on most common OSs using :\n\nMake sure you have a compiler and other common developer tools set up. For macOS, this means Xcode and its command line tools. For Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential git libgl1-mesa-dev libxcb-xinerama0`. Install the Qt with version 5.15 or later. Double check that you install a version compatible with your OS ( and ). Clone the Bandage code from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage.git`. Open the Qt Creator program and load the `Bandage.pro` file which is in the Bandage directory. Since this is the first time the project has been loaded, it will ask you to configure the project. The defaults should be okay, so click 'Configure Project'. Change to the release build configuration by clicking where it says 'Debug' in the bottom left area of Qt Creator and select 'Release'. Build and run Bandage by clicking the green arrow in the bottom left area of Qt Creator. Bandage should open when the build has finished. You will find the executable file in a new folder that begins with 'build-Bandage-Desktop'.\n\nNew contributors are welcome! If you're interested or have ideas, please contact me (Ryan) at rrwick@gmail.com.\n\nIf you use Bandage in your research, please cite the following publication:\n\nBandage makes use of the OGDF library for performing graph layout algorithms. My thanks goes out to the OGDF developers for their excellent work!\n\nI also thank Rayan Chikhi and Elmar Pruesse for their contributions to the code.\n\nGNU General Public License, version 3\""

Nijman, and P. Prins. . Bioinformatics, Table of Contents\n\n*January 2023*: announcing v1.0 release of the great sambamba tool!\n\nA minor fix and a major release. After 10 years and over one thousand citations we can announce sambamba 1.0 stable!\n\nSambamba is a high performance, highly parallel, robust and fast tool (and library), written in the D programming language, for working with SAM and BAM files. Because of its efficiency, Sambamba is an important work horse running in many sequencing centers around the world today. As of January 2023, Sambamba has been cited over  and has been installed from Conda over . Sambamba is also distributed by . To cite Sambamba, see .\n\nCurrent functionality is an important subset of `samtools`\nfunctionality including view, index, sort, markdup, and depth. Most\ntools support piping. Just specify `/dev/stdin` or `/dev/stdout` as\nfilenames. When we started writing Sambamba in 2012, the main\nadvantage over `samtools` was parallelized BAM reading and writing.\n\nIn March 2017, `samtools` 1.4 was released, reaching some parity. A  shows that Sambamba still holds its ground and can even do better. Here are some comparison . For example, for flagstat, Sambamba is 1.4x faster than samtools. For index, they are similar. For markdup, almost *6xfaster, and for view, *4xfaster. For sort, Sambamba has been beaten, though Sambamba is notably up to *2xfaster than samtools on large RAM machines (120GB+).\n\nIn addition, Sambamba has a few interesting features to offer. In particular:\n\nFast large machine `sort`, see \nAutomatic index creation when writing any coordinate-sorted file\n`view -L <bed file>` utilizes BAM index to skip unrelated chunks\n`depth` allows to measure base, sliding window, or region coverages\n  builds upon this and gets you to exon/gene levels of abstraction\n`markdup`, a fast implementation of Picard algorithm\n`slice` quickly extracts a region into a new file, tweaking only first/last chunks\n...and more (you'll have to try)\n\nThe D language is extremely suitable for high performance computing (HPC). At this point, we think that the BAM format is here to stay for processing reference guided sequencing data, and we aim to make it easy to parse and process BAM files.\n\nSambamba is free and open source software, licensed under GPLv2+.\nSee manual pages \nto know more about what is available and how to use it.\n\nFor more information on Sambamba, contact the mailing list (see ).\n\n**Important Notice: With version 0.8 support for CRAM was removed from\nSambamba (see the )*To use CRAM, you can still use one of the older (binary)\n of Sambamba.\n\nFor those not in the mood to learn/install new package managers, there\nare Github source and binary\n. Simply download\nthe tarball, unpack it, and run it according to the accompanying\nrelease notes.\n\nBelow package managers Conda, GNU Guix, Debian and Homebrew also\nprovide recent binary installs for Linux.  For MacOS you may use Conda\nor Homebrew.\n\nThere should be binary downloads for Linux and MacOS.\n\nWith Conda use the  channel.\n\nA reproducible  for Sambamba is available. The development version is packaged .\n\nSee also Debian package .\n\nUsers of Homebrew can also use the formula from .\n\n    brew install brewsci/bio/sambamba\n\nIt should work for Linux and MacOS.\n\nYou can find help and general discussion on the\n.\n\nBefore posting an issue, search the issue tracker and  first. It is likely someone may have encountered something similar. Also try running the latest version of Sambamba to make sure it has not been fixed already. Support/installation questions should be aimed at the mailing list. The issue tracker is for development issues around the software itself. When reporting an issue, include the output of the program and the contents of the output directory.\n\nPlease use the following checklist. It exists for multiple reasons. :)\n\n\n\n[X] I have found an issue with Sambamba\n(also check closed issues)\nof Sambamba\n[ ] I have read and agreed to the below code of conduct\nor added to an existing one\n[ ] In the message, I have included the output of my Sambamba run\n[ ] In the message, I have included relevant files in the output directory\n[ ] (Optional) I have made the data available to reproduce the problem\n\nTo find bugs, the Sambamba software developers may ask to install a development version of the software. They may also ask you for your data and will treat it confidentially.  Please always remember that Sambamba is written and maintained by volunteers with good intentions. Our time is valuable, too. By helping us as much as possible, we can provide this tool for everyone to use.\n\nBy using Sambamba and communicating with its community, you implicitly agree to abide by the  as published by the Software Carpentry initiative.\n\nNote: In general, there is no need to compile Sambamba. You can use a recent binary install as listed above.\n\nThe preferred method for compiling Sambamba is with the LDC compiler which targets LLVM. LLVM version 6 is faster than earlier editions.\n\nSee .\n\nThe LDC compiler's Github repository provides binary images. The current preferred release for Sambamba is LDC the LLVM D compiler (>= 1.6.1). After installing LDC from https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/ with, for example\n\nTo build a development/debug version run\n\nTo run the test, fetch shunit2 from https://github.com/kward/shunit2 and put it in the path so\nyou can run\n\nSee also .\n\nOur development and release environment is GNU Guix.  To build\nsambamba the LDC compiler is also available in GNU Guix:\n\nFor more instructions see .\n\nDebian uses a Meson+Ninja build. It may work with something like\n\nor possibly with some additional tuning runtimes get close to the optimized static build (see .\n\nSambamba builds on MacOS. We have a Travis  as\nan example. It can be something like\n\nSambamba development and issue tracker is on\n. Developer\ndocumentation can be found in the source code and the [development\ndocumentation](https://github.com/biod/sambamba-dev-docs).\n\nImportant Note: Some older Xeon processors segfault under heavy hyper\nthreading which Sambamba utilizes.  Please read\n\nwhen encountering seemingly random crashes. There is no real fix other\nthan disabling hyperthreading. Also discussed . Thank Intel for producing this bug.\n\nIn a crash, Sambamba can dump a core file. To make this happen set\n\nand run your command. Send us the core file so we can reproduce the state at\ntime of segfault.\n\nAnother option is to use `catchsegv`\n\nThis will show state on stdout which can be sent to us.\n\nIn case of crashes, it's helpful to have GDB stacktraces (`bt`\ncommand). A full stacktrace for all threads:\n\nNote that GDB should be made aware of D garbage collector, which emits\nSIGUSR signals and GDB needs to ignore them with\n\nA binary, relocatable install of Sambamba with debug information and\nall dependencies can be fetched from the binary link above.

Nanopolish can calculate an improved consensus sequence for a draft genome assembly, detect base modifications, call SNPs and indels with respect to a reference genome and more (see Nanopolish modules, below).\n\n\n\n\nPresently nanopolish does not support R10.4 flowcells as variant and methylation calling is accurate enough to not require signal-level analysis. We intend to support signal exploration through `eventalign` but do not currently have a timeline for this as our development time is currently dedicated to other projects.\n\n\n0.14.1: added the `compare_methylation.py` script from the  to the `nanopolish` package\n\n0.14.0: support modification bam files, compile on M1 apple hardware, support  files\n\n0.13.3: fix conda build issues, better handling of VBZ-compressed files, integration of module for \n\n0.13.2: fix memory leak when loading signal data\n\n0.13.1: fix `nanopolish index` performance issue for some barcoding runs\n\n0.13.0: modify HMM transitions to allow the balance between insertions and deletions to be changed depending on mode (consensus vs reference variants)\n\n0.12.5: make SupportFractionByStrand calculation consistent with SupportFraction\n\n0.12.4: add SupportFractionByStrand and SOR to VCF\n\n0.12.3: fix hdf5 file handle leak\n\n0.12.2: add RefContext info to VCF output of `nanopolish variants`\n\n0.12.1: improve how `nanopolish index` handles summary files, add support for selecting reads by BAM read group tags (for `nanopolish variants`)\n\n0.12.0: live methylation calling, methylation LLR threshold changes as described \n\n0.11.1: `nanopolish polya` now supports SQK-RNA-002 kits with automatic backwards-compatibility with SQK-RNA-001\n\n0.11.0: support for multi-fast5 files. `nanopolish methyltrain` now subsamples input data, improving speed and memory usage\n\n0.10.2: added new program `nanopolish polya` to estimate the length of poly-A tails on direct RNA reads (by @paultsw)\n\n0.10.1: `nanopolish variants --consensus` now only outputs a VCF file instead of a fasta sequence. The VCF file describes the changes that need to be made to turn the draft sequence into the polished assembly. A new program, `nanopolish vcf2fasta`, is provided to generate the polished genome (this replaces `nanopolish_merge.py`, see usage instructions below). This change is to avoid issues when merging segments that end on repeat boundaries (reported by Michael Wykes and Chris Wright).\n\n\n\nA compiler that supports C++11 is needed to build nanopolish. Development of the code is performed using .\n\nBy default, nanopolish will download and compile all of its required dependencies. Some users however may want to use system-wide versions of the libraries. To turn off the automatic installation of dependencies set `HDF5=noinstall`, `EIGEN=noinstall`, `HTS=noinstall` or `MINIMAP2=noinstall` parameters when running `make` as appropriate. The current versions and compile options for the dependencies are:\n\ncompiled with multi-threading support `--enable-threadsafe`\nIn order to use the additional python3 scripts within `/scripts`, install the dependencies via\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can download and compile the latest code from github as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen major features have been added or bugs fixed, we will tag and release a new version of nanopolish. If you wish to use a particular version, you can checkout the tagged version before compiling:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main subprograms of nanopolish are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNanopolish needs access to the signal-level data measured by the nanopore sequencer. The first step of any nanopolish workflow is to prepare the input data by telling nanopolish where to find the signal files. If you ran Albacore 2.0 on your data you should run `nanopolish index` on your input reads (-d can be specified more than once if using multiple runs):\n\n\n\nThe `-s` option tells nanopolish to read the `sequencing_summary.txt` file from Albacore to speed up indexing. Without this option `nanopolish index` is extremely slow as it needs to read every fast5 file individually. If you basecalled your run in parallel, so you have multiple `sequencing_summary.txt` files, you can use the `-f` option to pass in a file containing the paths to the sequencing summary files (one per line). When using SLOW5 files as the input (FAST5 can be converted to SLOW5 using ), `-s` option is not required and does not affect indexing performance. \n\n\n\nThe original purpose of nanopolish was to compute an improved consensus sequence for a draft genome assembly produced by a long-read assembly like . This section describes how to do this, starting with your draft assembly which should have megabase-sized contigs. We've also posted a tutorial including example data .\n\n\n\nNow, we use nanopolish to compute the consensus sequence (the genome is polished in 50kb blocks and there will be one output file per block). We'll run this in parallel:\n\n\n\nThis command will run the consensus algorithm on eight 50kbp segments of the genome at a time, using 4 threads each. Change the  and  options as appropriate for the machines you have available.\n\nAfter all polishing jobs are complete, you can merge the individual 50kb segments together back into the final assembly:\n\n\n\n\n\nnanopolish can use the signal-level information measured by the sequencer to detect 5-mC as described . We've posted a tutorial on how to call methylation .\n\n\n\nFirst build the image from the dockerfile:\n\nNote the uuid given upon successful build.\nThen you can run nanopolish from the image:\n\n\n\n\nThe fast table-driven logsum implementation was provided by Sean Eddy as public domain code. This code was originally part of . Nanopolish also includes code from Oxford Nanopore's  basecaller. This code is licensed under the MPL.\n\nThe `scripts/compare_methylation.py` was originally provided in the  which was obtained using:\""

Gene cluster comparison figure generator clinker is a pipeline for easily generating publication-quality gene cluster comparison figures. Given a set of GenBank files, clinker will automatically extract protein translations, perform global alignments between sequences in each cluster, determine the optimal display order based on cluster similarity, and generate an interactive visualisation (using ) that can be extensively tweaked before being exported as an SVG file. clinker was designed primarily as a simple way to visualise groups of homologous biosynthetic gene clusters, which are typically small genomic regions with not many genes (as in the example GIF). It performs pairwise alignments of all genes in all input files using the , then generates an interactive SVG document in the browser. The alignment stage will scale very poorly to multiple genomes with many genes, and the resulting visualisation will also be very slow given how many SVG elements it will contain. If you are looking to align entire genomes, you will likely be better served using tools built for that purpose (e.g. ). clinker can be installed directly through pip: pip install clinker By cloning the source code from GitHub: Or, through conda: If you found clinker useful, please cite: Running clinker can be as simple as: clinker clusters/*.gbk This will read in all GenBank files inside the folder, align them, and print the alignments to the terminal. To generate the visualisation, use the -p/--plot argument: clinker clusters/*.gbk -p <optional: file name to save static HTML> clinker can also parse GFF3 files: clinker cluster1.gff3 cluster2.gff3 -p Note: a corresponding FASTA file of the same name (extensions \".fa\", \".fsa\", \".fna\", \".fasta\" or \".faa\") must be found in the same directory as the GFF3, i.e. cluster1.fa and cluster2.fa. See -h/--help for more information: By default, clinker automatically assigns a name and colour for each group of homologous genes. You can instead pre-assign names (i.e. functions) using the -gf/--gene_functions argument, which takes a 2-column comma-separated file like: This will generate two groups, Cytochrome P450 (GENE_001 and 002), and Methyltransferase (GENE_003, GENE_004). If there any other homologous genes are identified, they will automatically be added to these groups. As of clinker v0.0.28, you can now specify colours for genes defined by the -gf/--gene_functions argument.

It takes the somewhat contrarian view that writing dataflows directly is unnecessarily restrictive, and by doing so we lose abstractions we have come to rely on in most modern high-level languages (control flow, composability, recursion, high order functions, etc). redun's key insight is that workflows can be expressed as , which are then evaluated by a scheduler that performs automatic parallelization, caching, and data provenance logging.\n\nredun's key features are:\n\nWorkflows are defined by lazy expressions that when evaluated emit dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling complex data flows.\nIncremental computation that is reactive to both data changes as well as code changes.\nWorkflow tasks can be executed on a variety of compute backend (threads, processes, AWS batch jobs, Spark jobs, etc). \nData changes are detected for in-memory values as well as external data sources such as files and object stores using file hashing.\nCode changes are detected by hashing individual Python functions and comparing them against historical call graph recordings.\nPast intermediate results are cached centrally and reused across workflows.\nPast call graphs can be used as a data lineage record and can be queried for debugging and auditing.\n\nTo learn more, see our  and  blog posts, as well as our , , and .\n\n*About the name:The name \"redun\" is self-deprecating (there are  of workflow engines), but it is also a reference to its original inspiration, the  build system.\n\nSee  for more information on working with the code.\n\n\n\nTo use postgres as a recording backend, use\n\n\n\nThe above assumes the following dependencies are installed:\n`pg_config` (in the `postgresql-devel` package; on ubuntu: `apt-get install libpq-dev`)\n`gcc` (on ubuntu or similar `sudo apt-get install gcc`)\n\n\n\nTo generate graphviz images and dot files, use\n\n\n\nThe above assumes the following dependencies are installed:\n`graphviz` (on ubuntu: `apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev`, via homebrew: `brew install graphviz`)\n`gcc` (on ubuntu or similar `sudo apt-get install gcc`)\n\n\n\nredun's general approach to defining workflows makes it a good choice for implementing workflows for a wide-variety of use cases:\n\nHere is a quick example of using redun for a familiar workflow, compiling a C program (). In general, any kind of data processing could be done within each task (e.g. reading and writing CSVs, DataFrames, databases, APIs).\n\n\n\nNotice, that besides the `@task` decorator, the code follows typical Python conventions and is organized like a sequential program.\n\nWe can run the workflow using the `redun run` command:\n\n\n\nThis should have taken three C source files (`lib.c`, `prog.c`, and `prog2.c`), compiled them to three object files (`lib.o`, `prog.o`, `prog2.o`), and then linked them into two binaries (`prog` and `prog2`). Specifically, redun automatically determined the following dataflow DAG and performed the compiling and linking steps in separate threads:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"400\" src=\"examples/02_compile/images/compile-dag.svg\">\n</p>\n\nUsing the `redun log` command, we can see the full job tree of the most recent execution (denoted `-`):\n\n\n\nNotice, redun automatically detected that `lib.c` only needed to be compiled once and that its result can be reused (a form of ).\n\nUsing the `--file` option, we can see all files (or URLs) that were read, `r`, or written, `w`, by the workflow:\n\n\n\nWe can also look at the provenance of a single file, such as the binary `prog`:\n\n\n\nThis output shows the original `link` task source code responsible for creating the program `prog`, as well as the full derivation, denoted \"upstream dataflow\". See the full example for a  of this output. To understand more about the data structure that powers these kinds of queries, see .\n\nWe can change one of the input files, such as `lib.c`, and rerun the workflow. Due to redun's automatic incremental compute, only the minimal tasks are rerun:\n\n\n\nNotice, two of the compile jobs are cached (`prog.c` and `prog2.c`), but compiling the library `lib.c` and the downstream link steps are correctly rerun.\n\nCheck out the  for more example workflows and features of redun. Also, see the  for more information on redun's design.\n\n\n\nAll workflow executions are recorded into a database that can be explored using the . The Console is convenient for debugging large complex workflows, as well as understanding how to reproduce and extend past work.\n\n<a href=\"docs/source/_static/console-execution.svg\"><img width=\"45%\" src=\"docs/source/_static/console-execution.svg\"> <a href=\"docs/source/_static/console-job.svg\"><img width=\"45%\" src=\"docs/source/_static/console-job.svg\">\n\n\n\nIn the above example, each task ran in its own thread. However, more generally each task can run in its own process, Docker container, , or . With , users can lightly annotate where they would like each task to run. redun will automatically handle the data and code movement as well as backend scheduling:\n\n\n\nSee the  for more.\n\n\n\nHow did redun automatically perform parallel compute, caching, and data provenance in the example above? The trick is that redun builds up an  representing the workflow and evaluates the expressions using . For example, the workflow above went through the following evaluation process:\n\n<img width=\"800\" src=\"examples/02_compile/images/expression-graph.svg\">\n\nFor a more in-depth walk-through, see the .\n\n\n\nredun focuses on making multi-domain scientific pipelines easy to develop and deploy. The automatic parallelism, caching, code, and data reactivity, as well as data provenance features, make it a great fit for such work. However, redun does not attempt to solve all possible workflow problems, so it's perfectly reasonable to supplement it with other tools. For example, while redun provides a very expressive way to define , it does not attempt to perform the kind of fine-grain  more commonly provided by Spark or Dask. Fortunately, redun does not perform any \"dirty tricks\" (e.g. complex static analysis or call stack manipulation), and so we have found it possible to safely combine redun with other frameworks (e.g. pyspark, pytorch, Dask, etc) to achieve the benefits of each tool.\n\nLastly, redun does not provide its own compute cluster but instead builds upon other systems that do, such as cloud provider services for batch Docker jobs or Spark jobs.\n\nFor more details on how redun compares to other related ideas, see the  section.\""

Meanwhile, our focus has shifted towards more adaptive implementations that react to an application’s real time performance rather than pre-configured settings (for example, through ). For the cases where something like Hystrix makes sense, we intend to continue using Hystrix for existing applications, and to leverage open and active projects like  for new internal projects. We are beginning to recommend others do the same.\n\nNetflix Hystrix is now officially in maintenance mode, with the following expectations to the greater community: \nNetflix will no longer actively review issues, merge pull-requests, and release new versions of Hystrix. \nWe have made a final release of Hystrix (1.5.18) per  so that the latest version in Maven Central is aligned with the last known stable version used internally at Netflix (1.5.11). \nIf members of the community are interested in taking ownership of Hystrix and moving it back into active mode, please reach out to hystrixoss@googlegroups.com.\n\nHystrix has served Netflix and the community well over the years, and the transition to maintenance mode is in no way an indication that the concepts and ideas from Hystrix are no longer valuable. On the contrary, Hystrix has inspired many great ideas and projects. We thank everyone at Netflix, and in the greater community, for all the contributions made to Hystrix over the years.\n\n\n\nHystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.\n\n\n\nSee the  for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.\n\nSee the  for the API.\n\n\n\nGoogle Group: \nTwitter: \nStop cascading failures.

It simplifies the creation, maintenance and reuse of software using independent and reusable components.\n\nYou can use Bit components to build new projects or reuse components to modernize your existing applications. Here are few examples to components people build with Bit:\n\nBit supports all tooling in the JS ecosystem and comes out of the box with official dev environments for , , , , ,  and . All are native to TypeScript and ESM and equipped with the best dev tooling.\n\nBit is a fit to every codebase structure. You can use Bit components in a monorepo, polyrepo, or even without repositories at all. \n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Bit installer to install Bit to be available on your PATH.\n\n\n\nInitialize Bit on a new folder or in an existing project by running the following command:\n\n\n\nMake sure to create your scope on the Bit platform and use the right org and project name. After running the command, Bit is initialized on the chosen directory, and ready to be used via Bit commands, your editor or the Bit UI!\n\n\n\nStart creating components using the default component generators, or .\n\n\n\nThe following command uses the React UI component template to create a new reusable React component:\n\n\n\nYou can find simple guides for creating NodeJS modules, UI components and apps, backend services and more on the . Run the Bit UI to preview components using the following command:\n\n\n\nUse `bit run` to preview applications during development. To create an application, follow the .\n\n\nAfter creating a new component, start using it by adding an import statement in one of your workspace components.\n\n\n\nOnce added, Bit will autodetect the dependency between these components.

It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.\n\nIf you have a trace ID in a log file, you can jump directly to it. Otherwise, you can query based on attributes such as service, operation name, tags and duration. Some interesting data will be summarized for you, such as the percentage of time spent in a service, and whether operations failed.\n\nThe Zipkin UI also presents a dependency diagram showing how many traced requests went through each application. This can be helpful for identifying aggregate behavior including error paths or calls to deprecated services.\n\nApplication’s need to be “instrumented” to report trace data to Zipkin. This usually means configuration of a . The most popular ways to report data to Zipkin are via http or Kafka, though many other options exist, such as Apache ActiveMQ, gRPC and RabbitMQ. The data served to the UI is stored in-memory, or persistently with a supported backend such as Apache Cassandra or Elasticsearch.\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to fetch the  as a self-contained executable jar. Note that the Zipkin server requires minimum JRE 17+. For example:\n\n```sh\ncurl -O https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin/zipkin-server/2.23.3/zipkin-server-2.23.3-exec.jar\njava -jar zipkin-server-2.23.3-exec.jar\n```\n\nYou can also start Zipkin via Docker.\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin\n```\n\nOnce the server is running, you can view traces with the Zipkin UI at http://localhost:9411/zipkin.\n\nIf your applications aren't sending traces, yet, configure them with  or try one of our .\n\nCheck out the  documentation for configuration details, or  for how to use docker-compose.\n\nThe slim build of Zipkin is smaller and starts faster. It supports in-memory and Elasticsearch storage, but doesn't support messaging transports like Kafka or RabbitMQ. If these constraints match your needs, you can try slim like below:\n\nRunning via Java:\n\n```sh\ncurl -O https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin/zipkin-slim/2.23.3/zipkin-slim-2.23.3-exec.jar\njava -jar zipkin-slim-2.23.3-exec.jar\n```\n\nRunning via Docker:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\n```\n\nRunning via Kubernetes:\n\n```sh\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openzipkin/zipkin/master/kubernetes/zipkin.yaml\n```\n\nThe  is used by both Zipkin instrumentation and the Zipkin server.\n\nThis includes built-in codec for Zipkin's v1 and v2 json formats. A direct dependency on gson\n(json library) is avoided by minifying and repackaging classes used. The result is a 155k jar which\nwon't conflict with any library you use.\n\nEx.\n\nNote: The above is just an example, most likely you'll want to use an existing tracing library like \n\nThe minimum Java language level of the core library is This helps support those writing agent\ninstrumentation. Version 2.x was the last to support Java *Note*: \ndoes not use this library. So,  still supports Java Zipkin includes a , used to store and query spans and\ndependency links. This is used by the server and those making collectors, or span reporters.\nFor this reason, storage components have minimal dependencies, though require Java 17+.\n\nEx.\n\nThe  component is packaged in zipkin's core library. It\nis neither persistent, nor viable for realistic work loads. Its purpose\nis for testing, for example starting a server on your laptop without any\ndatabase needed.\n\n\nThe  component uses Cassandra\n3.11.3features, but is tested against the latest patch of Cassandra 4.This is the second generation of our Cassandra schema. It stores spans\nusing UDTs, such that they appear like Zipkin v2 json in cqlsh. It is\ndesigned for scale, and uses a combination of SASI and manually\nimplemented indexes to make querying larger data more performant.\n\nNote: This store requires a  dependency links.\n\n\nThe  component uses\nElasticsearch 5features, but is tested against Elasticsearch 7-8.x and\nOpenSearch 2.x.\n\nIt stores spans as Zipkin v2 json so that integration with other tools is\nstraightforward. To help with scale, this uses a combination of custom\nand manually implemented indexing.\n\nNote: This store requires a  to aggregate dependency links.\n\n\nThe following API endpoints provide search features, and are enabled by\ndefault. Search primarily allows the trace list screen of the UI operate.\n`GET /services` Distinct Span.localServiceName\n`GET /remoteServices?serviceName=X` Distinct Span.remoteServiceName by Span.localServiceName\n`GET /spans?serviceName=X` Distinct Span.name by Span.localServiceName\n`GET /autocompleteKeys` Distinct keys of Span.tags subject to configurable whitelist\n`GET /autocompleteValues?key=X` Distinct values of Span.tags by key\n`GET /traces` Traces matching a query possibly including the above criteria\n\n\nWhen search is disabled, traces can only be retrieved by ID\n(`GET /trace/{traceId}`). Disabling search is only viable when there is\nan alternative way to find trace IDs, such as logs. Disabling search can\nreduce storage costs or increase write throughput.\n\n`StorageComponent.Builder.searchEnabled(false)` is implied when a zipkin\nis run with the env variable `SEARCH_ENABLED=false`.\n\n\nThe following components are no longer encouraged, but exist to help aid\ntransition to supported ones. These are indicated as \"v1\" as they use\ndata layouts based on Zipkin's V1 Thrift model, as opposed to the\nsimpler v2 data model currently used.\n\n\nThe  component uses MySQL 5.6features, but is tested against MariaDB 10.The schema was designed to be easy to understand and get started with;\nit was not designed for performance. Ex spans fields are columns, so\nyou can perform ad-hoc queries using SQL. However, this component has\nthe following limitations: queries will eventually take seconds to return\nif you put a lot of data into it.\n\nThis store does not require a  dependency links.\nHowever, running the job will improve performance of dependencies\nqueries.\n\n\nThe  receives spans via HTTP POST and respond to queries\nfrom its UI. It can also run collectors, such as RabbitMQ or Kafka.\n\nTo run the server from the currently checked out source, enter the\nfollowing.

Please check the release note at https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint/releases/tag/v3.0.1.\n\nThe current stable version is 3.0.1.\n\nTake a quick look at Pinpoint with our !!\n\nPinpoint also supports application written in PHP, Python.\n\nPinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Inspired by Zipkin, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.\n\nYou should definitely check Pinpoint if you want to:\n\n- Understand your application in real-time\n- Monitor your application in real-time\n- Gain code-level visibility to every transaction\n- Install APM Agents without changing a single line of code\n- Have minimal impact on the performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)\n\nFor a simple test run of Pinpoint, visit the provided links. For further instructions, please refer to the README.\n\nServices nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a blackbox. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.\n\n**ServerMap** Understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected. Clicking on a node reveals details about the component, such as its current status, and transaction count.\n\n**Realtime Active Thread Chart** Monitor active threads inside applications in real-time.\n\n**Request/Response Scatter Chart** Visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems. Transactions can be selected for additional detail by dragging over the chart.\n\n**CallStack** Gain code-level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment, identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view.\n\n**Inspector** View additional details on the application such as CPU usage, Memory/Garbage Collection, TPS, and JVM arguments.\n\n**URI-metric** Infrastructure **Error-Analysis** JDK 8, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Apache HttpClient, Jetty, Jackson, Hibernate, Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, HBase, HDFS, Flink, Pinot\n\nJava version required to run Pinpoint:\n| Pinpoint Version | Agent | Collector | Web | Batch | Flink |\n|------------------|-------|-----------|-----|-------|-------|\n| 2.0.x            | 6-13  | 8         | 8   | 8     | 8     |\n| 2.1.x            | 6-14  | 8         | 8   | 8     | 8     |\n| 2.2.x            | 7-14  | 8         | 8   | 8     | 8     |\n| 2.3.x            | 7-17  | 8         | 8   | 8     | 8     |\n| 2.4.x            | 7-18  | 11        | 11  | 11    | 11    |\n| 2.5.x            | 8-19  | 11        | 11  | 11    | 11    |\n| 3.0.x            | 8-21  | 17        | 17  | 17    | 17    |\n| 3.1.x            | 8-21  | 17        | 17  | 17    | 17    |\n\nHBase compatibility table:\n| Pinpoint Version | HBase 1.x | HBase 2.x                                                                                                             |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.0.x 2.2.x    | yes       |  |\n| 2.3.x 2.5.x    | yes       |                                     |\n| 3.0.x            | no        | yes                                                                                                                   |\n| 3.1.x            | no        | yes                                                                                                                   |\n\nAgent Collector compatibility table:\n| Agent Version | Collector 2.x.x | Collector 3.0.x | Collector 3.1.x |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 2.x.x         | yes             | yes             | yes             |\n| 3.0.x         | no              | yes             | yes             |\n| 3.1.x         | no              | no              | yes             |\n\nFlink compatibility table:\n| Pinpoint Version | Flink 1.3.X 1.7.X | Flink 1.14.X | Flink 1.18.X    |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 2.0.x 2.3.x    | yes                 | no           | no              |\n| 2.4.x 2.5.x    | yes                 | yes          | no              |\n| 3.0.x            | no                  | no           | yes(deprecated) |\n| 3.1.x            | no                  | no           | yes(deprecated) |\n\nPinot compatibility table:\n| Pinpoint Version | Pinot 0.11.0 | Pinot 0.12.0 | Pinot 1.0.0 |  |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.5.x            | yes          | yes          | yes         | yes                                                                  |\n| 3.0.x            | no           | no           | yes         | yes                                                                  |\n| 3.1.x            | no           | no           | no          | yes                                                                  |\n\nWe have a Chinese community now, welcome to join!\n\nDetails:\n- QQ Group1: 897594820\n- QQ Group2: 812507584\n- QQ Group3: 882020485\n- DING Group: 21981598\n\nPinpoint is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.

A test is a Clojure program which uses the Jepsen library to set up a distributed system, run a bunch of operations against that system, and verify that the history of those operations makes sense. Jepsen has been used to verify everything from eventually-consistent commutative databases to linearizable coordination systems to distributed task schedulers. It can also generate graphs of performance and availability, helping you characterize how a system responds to different faults. See  for examples of the sorts of analyses you can carry out with Jepsen.\n\nA Jepsen test runs as a Clojure program on a control node. That program uses SSH to log into a bunch of db nodes, where it sets up the distributed system you're going to test using the test's pluggable osand db.\n\nOnce the system is running, the control node spins up a set of logically single-threaded processes, each with its own client for the distributed system. A generator generates new operations for each process to perform. Processes then apply those operations to the system using their clients. The start and end of each operation is recorded in a history. While performing operations, a special nemesis process introduces faults into the system--also scheduled by the generator.\n\nFinally, the DB and OS are torn down. Jepsen uses a checker to analyze the test's history for correctness, and to generate reports, graphs, etc. The test, history, analysis, and any supplementary results are written to the filesystem under store/<test-name>/<date>/ for later review. Symlinks to the latest results are maintained at each level for convenience.\n\nThis  walks you through writing a Jepsen test from scratch.\n\nFor reference, see the .\n\nAn independent translation is available in .\n\nSo, you've got a Jepsen test, and you'd like to run it! Or maybe you'd like to start learning how to write tests. You've got several options:\n\nIf you have an AWS account, you can launch a full Jepsen cluster---control and db nodes---from the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Jepsen-LLC-Jepsen/B01LZ7Y7U0). Click \"Continue to Subscribe\", \"Continue to Configuration\", and choose \"CloudFormation Template\". You can choose the number of nodes you'd like to deploy, adjust the instance types and disk sizes, and so on. These are full VMs, which means they can test clock skew.\n\nThe AWS marketplace clusters come with an hourly fee (generally $1/hr/node), which helps fund Jepsen development.\n\nYou can set up your db nodes as LXC containers, and use your local machine as the control node. See the  for guidelines. This might be the easiest setup for hacking on tests: you'll be able to edit source code, run profilers, etc on the local node. Containers don't have real clocks, so you generally can't use them to test clock skew.\n\nYou should be able to run Jepsen against almost any machines which have:\n\nA TCP network\nAn SSH server\nSudo or root access\n\nEach db node should be accessible from the control node via SSH: you need to be able to run `ssh myuser@some-node`, and get a shell. By default, db nodes are named n1, n2, n3, n4, and n5, but that (along with ssh username, password, identity files, etc) is all definable in your test, or at the CLI. The account you use on those boxes needs sudo access to set up dbs, control firewalls, etc.\n\nBE ADVISED: tests may mess with clocks, add apt repos, run killall -9 on processes, and generally break things, so you shouldn't, you know, point Jepsen at your prod machines unless you like to live dangerously, or you wrote the test and know exactly what it's doing.\n\nNOTE: Most Jepsen tests are written with more specific requirements in mind---like running on Debian, using `iptables` for network manipulation, etc. See the specific test code for more details.\n\nThere is a  for running a Jepsen cluster on a single machine. Sadly the Docker platform has been something of a moving target; this environment tends to break in new and exciting ways on various platforms every few months. If you're a Docker whiz and can get this going reliably on Debian & OS X that's great--pull requests would be a big help.\n\nLike other containers Docker containers don't have real clocks--that means you generally can't use them to test clock skew.\n\nFor AWS and Docker installs, your control node comes preconfigured with all the software you'll need to run most Jepsen tests. If you build your own control node (or if you're using your local machine as a control node), you'll need a few things:\n\nA JVM version 1.8 or higher.\nJNA, so the JVM can talk to your ssh.\nclojure, a Clojure build tool.\ngnuplot, how Jepsen renders performance plots.\ngraphviz, how Jepsen renders transactional anomalies.\n\nOn Debian, try:\n\n`sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk libjna-java leiningen gnuplot graphviz`\n\n... to get the basic requirements in place. Debian's Leiningen packages are ancient, so ...\n\nOnce you've got everything set up, you should be able to run `cd aerospike; lein test`, and it'll spit out something like\n\nJepsen tests emit .jepsen files in the store/ directory. You can use these to investigate a test at the repl. Run `lein repl` in the test directory (which should contain store...), then load a test using store/test:\n\n-1 is the last test run, -2 is the second-to-last. 0 is the first, 1 is the second, and so on.

Every developer on your team has their own copy of the review history that they can push or pull. When pulling, updates from the remote repo are automatically merged by the tool.\n\nThis design removes the need for any sort of server-side setup. As a result, this tool can work with any git hosting provider, and the only setup required is installing the client on your workstation.\n\nAssuming you have the , run the following command:\n\n    go install github.com/google/git-appraise/git-appraise@latest\n\nThen, either make sure that `${GOPATH}/bin` is in your PATH, or explicitly add the \"appraise\" git alias by running the following command.\n\n    git config --global alias.appraise '!'\"${GOPATH}/bin/git-appraise\"\n    git config --global alias.appraise \"!%GOPATH%/bin/git-appraise.exe\"\n\nThis tool expects to run in an environment with the following attributes:\n\n- The git command line tool is installed, and included in the PATH.\n- The tool is run from within a git repo.\n- The git command line tool is configured with the credentials it needs to push to and pull from the remote repos.\n\nRequesting a code review:\n\n    git appraise request\n\nPushing code reviews to a remote:\n\n    git appraise push [<remote>]\n\nPulling code reviews from a remote:\n\n    git appraise pull [<remote>]\n\nListing open code reviews:\n\n    git appraise list\n\nShowing the status of the current review, including comments:\n\n    git appraise show\n\nShowing the diff of a review:\n\n    git appraise show --diff [--diff-opts \"<diff-options>\"] [<review-hash>]\n\nCommenting on a review:\n\n    git appraise comment -m \"<message>\" [-f <file> [-l <line>]] [<review-hash>]\n\nAccepting the changes in a review:\n\n    git appraise accept [-m \"<message>\"] [<review-hash>]\n\nSubmitting the current review:\n\n    git appraise submit [--merge | --rebase]\n\nA more detailed getting started doc is available .\n\nThe code review data is stored in , using the formats described below.

This allows the git notes to be automatically merged using the \"cat_sort_unique\" strategy.\n\nSince these notes are not in a human-friendly form, all of the refs used to track them start with the prefix \"refs/notes/devtools\". This helps make it clear that these are meant to be read and written by automated tools.\n\nWhen a field named \"v\" appears in one of these notes, it is used to denote the version of the metadata format being used. If that field is missing, then it defaults to the value 0, which corresponds to this initial version of the formats.\n\nCode review requests are stored in the \"refs/notes/devtools/reviews\" ref, and annotate the first revision in a review.

The data in these secondary stores is often derived from the primary data through custom transformations, sometimes involving complex processing driven by business logic. Similarly, data in caching tiers is derived from reads against the primary data store, but needs to get invalidated or refreshed when the primary data gets mutated. A fundamental requirement emerging from these kinds of data architectures is the need to reliably capture, flow and process primary data changes.\n\nWe have built Databus, a source-agnostic distributed change data capture system, which is an integral part of LinkedIn's data processing pipeline. The Databus transport layer provides latencies in the low milliseconds and handles throughput of thousands of events per second per server while supporting infinite look back capabilities and rich subscription functionality. \n\nTypically, Primary OLTP data-stores take user facing writes and some reads, while other specialized systems serve complex queries or accelerate query results through caching. The most common data systems found in these architectures include relational databases, NoSQL data stores, caching engines, search indexes and graph query engines. This specialization has in turn made it critical to have a reliable and scalable data pipeline that can capture these changes happening for primary source-of-truth systems and route them through the rest of the complex data eco-system. There are two families of solutions that are typically used for building such a pipeline.\n\nIn this model, the application layer writes to the database and in parallel, writes to another messaging system. This looks simple to implement since the application code writing to the database is under our control. However it introduces a consistency problem because without a complex co-ordination protocol (e.g. Paxos or 2-Phase Commit ) it is hard to ensure that both the database and the messaging system are in complete lock step with each other in the face of failures. Both systems need to process exactly the same writes and need to serialize them in exactly the same order. Things get even more complex if the writes are conditional or have partial update semantics.\n\nIn this model, we make the database the single source-of-truth and extract changes from its transaction or commit log. This solves our consistency issue, but is practically hard to implement because databases like Oracle and MySQL (the primary data stores in use at LinkedIn) have transaction log formats and replication solutions that are proprietary and not guaranteed to have stable on-disk or on-the-wire representations across version upgrades.  Since we want to process the data changes with application code and then write to secondary data stores, we need the replication system to be user-space and source-agnostic. This independence from the data source is especially important in fast-moving technology companies, because it avoids technology lock-in and tie-in to binary formats throughout the application stack.\n\nAfter evaluating the pros and cons of the two approaches, we decided to pursue the log mining option, prioritizing consistency and \"single source of truth\" over ease of implementation. In this paper, we introduce Databus, Change Data Capture pipeline at LinkedIn, which supports Oracle sources and a wide range of downstream applications. The Social Graph Index which serves all graph queries at LinkedIn, the People Search Index that powers all searches for members at LinkedIn and the various read replicas for our Member Profile data are all fed and kept consistent via Databus.\n\nMore details about the architecture, usecases and performance evaluation can be obtained from a paper that got accepted for publication at the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing The slides for the presentation are available \n\nDatabus requires a library distributed by Oracle Inc under Oracle Technology Network License. Please accept that license , and download ojdbc6.jar with version at 11.2.0.2.0 . Once you download the driver jar, please copy it under sandbox-repo/com/oracle/ojdbc6/11.2.0.2.0/ and name it ojdbc6-11.2.0.2.0.jar as shown below. We have provided a sample .ivy file to facilitate the build.\n\nDatabus will **NOT*build without this step. After downloading the jars, they may be copied under the directory sandbox-repo as :\nsandbox-repo/com/oracle/ojdbc6/11.2.0.2.0/ojdbc6-11.2.0.2.0.jar\nsandbox-repo/com/oracle/ojdbc6/11.2.0.2.0/ojdbc6-11.2.0.2.0.ivy\n\nDatabus currently needs gradle version 1.0 or above to build. The commands to build are :\n`gradle -Dopen_source=true assemble` -builds the jars and command line package\n`gradle -Dopen_source=true clean`    -cleans the build directory\n`gradle -Dopen_source=true test`     -runs all the unit-tests that come packaged with the source\n\nDatabus will be licensed under Apache 2.0 license.\n\nSee our  for full documentation and examples.\n\nAn example of writing a DatabusRelay is available at PersonRelayServer.java. To be able to start a relay process, the code is packaged into a startable command-line package. The tarball may be obtained from build/databus2-example-relay-pkg/distributions/databus2-example-relay-pkg.tgz. This relay is configured to get changestreams for a view \"Person\".\n\nAfter extracting to a directory, please cd to that directory and start the relay using the following command :\n`./bin/start-example-relay.sh person`\n\nIf the relay is started successfully, the output of the following curl command would look like :\n$ `curl http://localhost:11115/sources`\n`[{“name”:“com.linkedin.events.example.person.Person”,“id”:40}]`\n\nAn example of writing a DatabusClient is available at PersonClientMain.java.

Data flows through memory, optionally to disk. Multiple map reduce steps are merged together for better performance.\n\nGleam does not have the common GC problem that plagued other languages. Each executor runs in a separated OS process. The memory is managed by the OS. One machine can host many more executors. Gleam master and agent servers are memory efficient, consuming about 10 MB memory. Gleam tries to automatically adjust the required memory size based on data size hints, avoiding the try-and-error manual memory tuning effort.\n\nThe Gleam flow can run standalone or distributed. Adjustable in memory mode or OnDisk mode.\n\nThe Go code is much simpler to read than Scala, Java, C++.\n\nGleam code defines the flow, specifying each dataset(vertex) and computation step(edge), and build up a directed acyclic graph(DAG). There are multiple ways to execute the DAG.\n\nThe default way is to run locally. This works in most cases. Here we mostly talk about the distributed mode.\n\nThe distributed mode has several names to explain: Master, Agent, Executor, Driver.\n\nDriver is the program users write, it defines the flow, and talks to Master, Agents, and Executors.\n\nThe Master is one single server that collects resource information from Agents. It stores transient resource information and can be restarted. When the Driver program starts, it asks the Master for available Executors on Agents.\n\nAgents runs on any machine that can run computations. Agents periodically send resource usage updates to Master. When the Driver program has executors assigned, it talks to the Agents to start Executors. Agents also manage datasets generated by each Executors.\n\nExecutors are started by Agents. They will read inputs from external or previous datasets, process them, and output to a new dataset.\n\nThe datasets are managed by Agents. By default, the data run only through memory and network, not touching slow disk. Optionally the data can be persist to disk. By leaving it in memory, the flow can have back pressure, and can support stream computation naturally.\n\nBasically, you need to register the Go functions first. It will return a mapper or reducer function id, which we can pass it to the flow.\n\nNow you can execute the binary directly or with \"-distributed\" option to run in distributed mode. The distributed mode would need a simple setup described later.\n\nA bit more blown up example is here, using the predefined mapper or reducer: https://github.com/chrislusf/gleam/blob/master/examples/word_count_in_go/word_count_in_go.go\n\nHere is another way to do the similar by unix pipe tools. Unix Pipes are easy for sequential pipes, but limited to fan out, and even more limited to fan in. With Gleam, fan-in and fan-out parallel pipes become very easy. This example used OutputRow() to process the output row directly. Assume there are file \"a.csv\" has fields \"a1, a2, a3, a4, a5\" and file \"b.csv\" has fields \"b1, b2, b3\". We want to join the rows where a1 = bAnd the output format should be \"a1, a4, b3\".\n\nStart a gleam master and several gleam agents\n\nInstall At the very least you will need a local K8s cluster, Docker & Kubectl. Docker Desktop.\n\nChoose the appropriate binary. For example, ARM64:\n\nUse `skaffold delete --profile base` to bring the cluster down.\n\nYou can build a local copy of gleam for development with hot reloading.\n\nAfter the flow is defined, the Run() function can be executed in local mode or distributed mode.\n\nFault tolerant. Read data from Local, HDFS, or SData Sources, with Raw Socket\n\nGleam is just beginning. Here are a few todo items. Welcome any help!\n\nAdd windowing functions similar to Apache Beam/Flink. (in progress)\nAdd schema support for each dataset.\nSupport using SQL as a flow step, similar to LINQ.\nAdd dataset metadata for better caching of often re-calculated data.\n\nEspecially Need Help Now:\nGo implementation to read Parquet files.\n\nPlease start to use it and give feedback. Help is needed. Anything is welcome.

This is written in pure Go.\n\nI am also working on another pure-Go system, https://github.com/chrislusf/gleam, which is more flexible and more performant.\n\nHere is a simple full example:\n\nTry it.\n\nIt will run the input text file, '/etc/passwd', in 3 go routines, filter/map/map, and then reduced to one number in one goroutine (not exactly one goroutine, but let's skip the details for now.) and print it out.\n\nThis is useful already, saving lots of idiomatic but repetitive code on channels, sync wait, etc, to fully utilize more CPU cores.\n\nHowever, there is one more thing! It can run across a Glow cluster, which can be run multiple servers/racks/data centers!\n\nTo setup the Glow cluster, we do not need experts on Zookeeper/HDFS/Mesos/YARN etc. Just build or download one binary file.\n\nGlow Master and Glow Agent run very efficiently. They take about 6.5MB and 5.5MB memory respectively in my environments. I would recommend set up agents on any server you can find. You can tap into the computing power whenever you need to.\n\nTo leap from one computer to clusters of computers, add this line to the import list:\n\n```go\nimport \"github.com/chrislusf/glow\"\n```\n\nAnd put this line as the first statement in the main() function:\n\n```go\nglow.EnableCluster()\n```\n\nThis will \"steroidize\" the code to run in cluster mode!\n\nThe word_count program will become a driver program, dividing the execution into a directed acyclic graph(DAG), and send tasks to agents.\n\nTo understand how each executor works, you can visualize the flow by generating a dot file of the flow, and render it to png file via \"dot\" command provided from graphviz.\n\nWiki page: https://github.com/chrislusf/glow/wiki\n\nMailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/\n\nExamples: https://github.com/chrislusf/glow/tree/master/examples/\n\nDocker is not required.

It uses the testing library to test toy implementations of distributed systems. Maelstrom provides standardized tests for things like \"a commutative set\" or \"a transactional key-value store\", and lets you learn by writing implementations which those test suites can exercise. It's used as a part of a distributed systems workshop by .\n\nMaelstrom provides a command for different kinds of distributed systems, built on top of a simple JSON protocol via STDIN and STDOUT. Users write servers in any language. Maelstrom runs those servers, sends them requests, routes messages via a simulated network, and checks that clients observe expected behavior. You want to write Plumtree in Bash? Byzantine Paxos in Intercal? Maelstrom is for you.\n\nMaelstrom's tooling lets users experiment with simulated latency and message loss of concurrency structure, on messages exchanged, to understand how latency, availability, and throughput respond to changing conditions, and so you can understand exactly how messages flow through your system. Maelstrom's checkers can verify up to strict serializability, and generate intuitive, minimal examples of consistency anomalies.\n\nMaelstrom can help you model how a system responds to different cluster sizes, network topologies, latency distributions, and faults like network partitions. Maelstrom also offers an API that you can use to build more complex systems.\n\nIt's built for testing toy systems, but don't let that fool you: Maelstrom is reasonably fast and can handle simulated clusters of 25nodes. On a 48-way Xeon, it can use 94% of all cores, pushing upwards of 60,000 network messages/sec.\n\nThe Maelstrom Guide will take you through writing several different types of distributed algorithms using Maelstrom. We begin by setting up Maelstrom and its dependencies, write our own tiny echo server, and move on to more sophisticated workloads.\n\nThere are also several reference documents that may be helpful:\n\ndefines Maelstrom's \"network\" protocol, message structure, RPC semantics, and error handling.\ndescribes the various kinds of workloads that Maelstrom can test, and define the messages involved in that particular workload.\nexplains how to interpret the various plots, data structures, and log files generated by a test.\ndiscusses Maelstrom's built-in network services, which you can use as primitives in building more complex systems.\n\nMaelstrom is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It uses Jepsen to generate operations, record a history of their results, and analyze what happens.\n\nWriting \"real\" distributed systems involves a lot of busywork: process management, networking, and message serialization are complex, full of edge cases, and difficult to debug across languages. In addition, running a full cluster of virtual machines connected by a real IP network is tricky for many users. Maelstrom strips these problems away so you can focus on the algorithmic essentials: process state, transitions, and messages.\n\nThe \"nodes\" in a Maelstrom test are plain old binaries written in any language. Nodes read \"network\" messages as JSON from STDIN, write JSON \"network\" messages to STDOUT, and do their logging to STDERR. Maelstrom runs those nodes as processes on your local machine, and connects them via a simulated network. Maelstrom runs a collection of simulated network clients which make requests to those nodes, receive responses, and records a history of those operations. At the end of a test run, Maelstrom analyzes that history to identify safety violations.\n\nThis allows learners to write their nodes in whatever language they are most comfortable with, without having to worry about discovery, network communication, daemonization, writing their own distributed test harness, and so on. It also means that Maelstrom can perform sophisticated fault injection and trace analysis.\n\nMaelstrom starts in maelstrom.core, which parses CLI operations and constructs a test map. It hands that off to Jepsen, which sets up the servers and Maelstrom services via maelstrom.db. Spawning binaries and handling their IO is done in maelstrom.process, and Maelstrom's internal services (e.g. lin-kv) are defined in maelstrom.service. Jepsen then spawns clients depending on the workload (maelstrom.workload.*) and a nemesis (maelstrom.nemesis) to inject faults.\n\nMessages between nodes are routed by maelstrom.net, and logged in maelstrom.journal. Clients send requests and parse responses via maelstrom.client, which also defines Maelstrom's RPC protocol.\n\nAt the end of the test, Jepsen checks the history using a checker built in maelstrom.core: workload-specific checkers are defined in their respective workload namespaces. Network statistics are computed in maelstrom.net.journal, and Lamport diagrams are generated by maelstrom.net.viz.\n\nmaelstrom.doc helps generate documentation based on maelstrom.client's registry of RPC types and workloads.\n\nA full list of options is available by running java -jar maelstrom.jar test --help. The important ones are:\n\n--workload NAME: What kind of workload should be run?\n--bin SOME_BINARY: The program you'd like Maelstrom to spawn instances of\n--node-count NODE-NAME: How many instances of the binary should be spawned?\n\nTo get more information, use:\n\n--log-stderr: Show STDERR output from each node in the Maelstrom log\n--log-net-send: Log messages as they are sent into the network\n--log-net-recv: Log messages as they are received by nodes\n\nTo make tests more or less aggressive, use:\n\n--time-limit SECONDS: How long to run tests for\n--rate FLOAT: Approximate number of requests per second\n--concurrency INT: Number of clients to run concurrently. Use 4n for 4 times the number of nodes.\n--latency MILLIS: Approximate simulated network latency, during normal operations.\n--latency-dist DIST: What latency distribution should Maelstrom use?\n--nemesis FAULT_TYPE: A comma-separated list of faults to inject\n--nemesis-interval SECONDS: How long between nemesis operations, on average\n\nFor broadcast tests, try\n\n--topology TYPE: Controls the shape of the network topology Jepsen offers to nodes\n\nFor transactional tests, you can control transaction generation using\n\n--max-txn-length INT: The maximum number of operations per transaction\n--key-count INT: The number of concurrent keys to work with\n--max-writes-per-key INT: How many unique write operations to generate per key.\n\nSSH options are unused; Maelstrom runs entirely on the local node.\n\nYou probably cloned this repository or downloaded the source and didn't compile it. Download the compiled release tarball instead; you'll find it on the GitHub release page.\n\nIf you want to run directly from source, you'll need the Leiningen build system. Instead of ./maelstrom ..., run lein run ...\n\nYou may find that node processes maelstrom starts are not terminating at the end of a run as expected. To address this, make sure that if the process passed as --bin forks off a new process, it also handles the process' termination.\n\nIn bin/raft\n\nIn bin/raft\n\nCopyright © 2017, 2020--2022 Kyle Kingsbury, Kit Patella, & Jepsen, LLC\n\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License either version 1.0 or (at your option) any later version.\""

We'll be providing frequent updates here and on our as we make progress.\n\n[x] Service Fabric build tools for Linux\n[x] Basic tests for Linux builds available\n[x] Container image with build tools available to run builds\n\nWe have multiple repositories (in addition to this one) that constitute the Service Fabric product. For more information on how to provide feedback and file issues across the different components (and associated repositories), please see .\n\nThe requirements below are based off running clean builds using ninja, with the command\n\nThe builds were run on with added disk capacity. If you want to build on an Azure machine you need to add approximately 70GB for the source+build outputs.\n\nThese times should be taken as estimates of how long a build will take.\n\n| Machine SKU | Cores | Memory | Build Time |\n|-------------|-------|--------|------------|\n| Standard_D8s_v3 | 8 | 32GB | ~4 hours |\n| Standard_D16s_v3 | 16 | 64GB | ~2 hours |\n| Standard_D32s_v3 | 32 | 128GB | ~1 hour |\n\nOn a smaller VM (Standard_D4s_V3 / 4 cores / 16GB) the build may fail. You may be able to build on a machine with less RAM if you limit the parallelism using the `-j` switch.\n\nThe build also requires approximately 70GB of disk space.\n\nThis is the Linux version of Service Fabric.

In order to get started you will need to . Here is how to install on Ubuntu:\n\nBy default docker requires root privelages to run. In order to run docker as a regular user (i.e, not root), you need to add the user to the `docker` user group:\n\nYou do not need to do this, but note that if you skip this step, you must run all docker commands with sudo.\n\nTo start the build inside of a docker container you can clone the repository and run this command from the root directory:\n\nThis will do a full build of the project with the output being placed into the `out` directory. For more options see `runbuild.sh -h`.\n\nAdditionally in order to build and create the installer packages you can pass in the `-createinstaller` option to the script:\n\nIf you would prefer to build the container locally, you can run the following script:\n\nCurrently, the build container is based off a base image that includes a few Service Fabric dependencies that have either not yet been open sourced, or must be included due to technical constraints (for example, some .NET files currently only build on Windows, but are required for a Linux build). This will pull all of the required packages, add Service Fabric internal dependencies, and apply patches.\n\nA common issue with building a docker container behind a firewall is when the firewall blocks the default DNS used by docker. This will manifest as packages failing to download during the `docker build` step (such as in the `builddocker.sh` script above). To fix this, you need to tell Docker to use an alternative DNS server. As a root user, create or edit the Docker daemon's config file at `/etc/docker/daemon.json` so that it has an entry that looks like this:\n\nTake note to replace the above command with your actual local DNS server, and restart docker:\n\nFor more details please refer to .\n\nFor more details please refer\n\nService Fabric conceptual and reference documentation is available at .

It's an on-prem solution that's designed to be a sort of building block: easy to understand, easy to operate, and easy to extend.\n\nYou may consider OK Log if...\n\nYou're tailing your logs manually, find it annoying, and want to aggregate them without a lot of fuss\nYou're using a hosted solution like Loggly, and want to move logs on-prem\nYou're using Elasticsearch, but find it unreliable, difficult to operate, or don't use many of its features\nYou're using a custom log pipeline with e.g. Fluentd or Logstash, and having performance problems\nYou just wanna, like, grep your logs — why is this all so complicated?\n\nOK Log is distributed as a single, statically-linked binary for a variety of target architectures. Download the latest release from .\n\nIf you have relatively small log volume, you can deploy a cluster of identical ingeststore nodes. By default, the replication factor is 2, so you need at least 2 nodes. Use the -cluster flag to specify a routable IP address or hostname for each node to advertise itself on. And let each node know about at least one other node with the -peer flag.\n\nTo grow the cluster, just add a new node, and tell it about at least one other node via the -peer flag. Optionally, you can run the rebalance tool (TODO) to redistribute the data over the new topology. To shrink the cluster, just kill nodes fewer than the replication factor, and run the repair tool (TODO) to re-replicate lost records.\n\nAll configuration is done via commandline flags. You can change things like the log retention period (default 7d), the target segment file size (default 128MB), and maximum time (age) of various stages of the logging pipeline. Most defaults should be sane, but you should always audit for your environment.\n\nIf you have relatively large log volume, you can split the ingest and store (query) responsibilities. Ingest nodes make lots of sequential writes, and benefit from fast disks and moderate CPU. Store nodes make lots of random reads and writes, and benefit from large disks and lots of memory. Both ingest and store nodes join the same cluster, so provide them with the same set of peers.\n\nTo add more raw ingest capacity, add more ingest nodes to the cluster. To add more storage or query capacity, add more store nodes. Also, make sure you have enough store nodes to consume from the ingest nodes without backing up.\n\nThe forwarder is basically just netcat with some reconnect logic. Pipe the stdout/stderr of your service to the forwarder, configured to talk to your ingesters.\n\nOK Log integrates in a straightforward way with runtimes like Docker and Kubernetes. See  for more details.\n\nQuerying is an HTTP GET to /query on any of the store nodes. OK Log comes with a query tool to make it easier to play with. One good thing is to first use the -stats flag to refine your query. When you're satisfied it's sufficiently constrained, drop -stats to get results.\n\nTo query structured logs, combine a basic grep filter expression with a tool like .\n\nOK Log ships with a basic UI for making queries. You can access it on any store or ingeststore node, on the public API port (default 7650), path `/ui`. So, e.g. http://localhost:7650/ui.\n\n--by\nfrom the\n.\nDevelopment supported by .\""

It uses RocksDB as the storage engine, and all data is stored to disks through RocksDB. Users can access Tendis using a Redis client, and the application hardly needs to be changed. In addition, Tendis supports storage capacity far exceeding memory, which can greatly reduce user storage costs.\n\nSimilar to Redis clusters, Tendis uses a decentralized distributed solution. The gossip protocol is used for communication between nodes, and all nodes in a cluster can be routed to the correct node when a user accesses. Cluster nodes support automatic discovery of other nodes, detect faulty nodes, and ensure the application is almost not affected when the master node failed.\n\nRedis compatibility\nRedis protocol and commands supported in Tendis are compatible with Redis.\n\nPersistent storage\nUsing RocksDB as storage engine. All data is stored in RocksDB in a specific format, supporting PB-level storage capacity.\n\nDecentralized distributed cluster\nDistributed implementation like Redis clusters, using a gossip protocol to intercommunicate between nodes.\n\nHorizontal scalability\nData migration online between nodes. High performance and linear scalability up to 1,000 nodes.\n\nFailover\nAuto-detect non-working nodes, and promote replica nodes to master when a failure occurs.\n\nKey component for Tendis Hybrid Storage Edition\nThanks to the design and internal optimization, Redis and Tendis can work together to be Hybrid Storage Edition. It is suitable for KV storage scenarios, as it balances performance and cost, and greatly reduces your business operating costs by 80% in the scenarios where cold data takes up a lot of storage space.\n\ng+(required by c++17, version >= 5.5)\ncmake (version >= 3.13.0)\n\nConnect to the server via redis-cli\n\nYou can make some change to the code and make sure the following test script pass.\n\ntendisplus: workers = 56\n\nlatency:\n\ntendisplus: workers = 56\n\nwe test set for half an hour, and then test get key half an hour. because the data is not big enough, most of the data is in memory, so the get qps for different payload is nearly the same.\n\nFor more information regarding contributing issues or pull requests, checkout\n\nCheckout for FAQs or join our discussion groups.\n\nTendis is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3.

After February 1, 2018, a fleet container image will continue to be available from the CoreOS Quay registry, but will not be shipped as part of Container Linux. CoreOS instead.\n\nThe project exists here for historical reference. If you are interested in the future of the project and taking over stewardship, please contact fleet@coreos.com\n\nfleet ties together systemd and etcd into a simple distributed init system. Think of it as an extension of systemd that operates at the cluster level instead of the machine level.\n\nThis project is quite low-level, and is designed as a foundation for higher order orchestration. fleet is a cluster-wide elaboration on systemd units, and is not a container manager or orchestration system. fleet supports basic scheduling of systemd units across nodes in a cluster. Those looking for more complex scheduling requirements or a first-class container orchestration system should check out Kubernetes. The fleet and kubernetes comparison table has more information about the two systems.\n\nThe fleet project is . As of v1.0.0, fleet has seen production use for some time and is largely considered stable. However, there are, including scalability limitations with its architecture. As such, it is not recommended to run fleet clusters larger than 100 nodes or with more than 1000 services.\n\nLaunching a unit with fleet is as simple as running fleetctl start:\n\nThe fleetctl start command waits for the unit to get scheduled and actually start somewhere in the cluster. fleetctl list-unit-files tells you the desired state of your units and where they are currently scheduled:\n\nfleetctl list-units exposes the systemd state for each unit in your fleet cluster:\n\nfleet is not intended to be an all-purpose orchestration system, and as such supports only a few simple deployment patterns:\n\nDeploy a single unit anywhere on the cluster\nDeploy a unit globally everywhere in the cluster\nAutomatic rescheduling of units on machine failure\nEnsure that units are deployed together on the same machine\nForbid specific units from colocation on the same machine (anti-affinity)\nDeploy units to machines only with specific metadata\n\nThese patterns are all defined using custom systemd unit options.\n\nBefore you can deploy units, fleet must be deployed and configured on each host in your cluster. (If you are running CoreOS, fleet is already installed.)\n\nAfter you have machines configured (check fleetctl list-machines), get to work with the client.\n\nfleet must be built with Go 1.5 on a Linux machine. Simply run ./build and then copy the binaries out of bin/ directory onto each of your machines. The tests can similarly be run by simply invoking ./test.\n\nIf you're on a machine without Go 1.5 but you have Docker installed, run ./build-docker to compile the binaries instead.\n\nThe fleet API uses JSON over HTTP to manage units in a fleet cluster. See the API documentation for more information.\n\nSee the releases tab for more information on each release.\n\nfleet is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

Using a high-performance and high-availability distributed cluster architecture, Tair can meet businesses' high requirements for read/write performance and scalable capacity.\n\nA Tair cluster has three necessary modules: the ConfigServer, DataServer and client.\n\nGenerally, a Tair cluster includes two ConfigServers and multiple DataServers. The two ConfigServers act as primary and standby servers. Heartbeat checks between the DataServer and ConfigServer are used to check live and available DataServers in the cluster to establish the distribution of data in the cluster. DataServers store, copy and migrate data as directed by the ConfigServer. When a client is launched, it obtains data distribution information from the ConfigServer. Based on this data distribution information, the client interacts with the corresponding DataServers to perform the user's requests.\n\nIn terms of architecture, the role of ConfigServer is similar to the central node in traditional application systems. The whole cluster service depends on the ConfigServer. In fact, Tair's ConfigServers are extremely lightweight. When a working ConfigServer is experiencing downtime, another ConfigServer automatically takes over within seconds. Even if two ConfigServers are experiencing downtime simultaneously, Tair can run normally as long as there is no change in the DataServers. Users only need to connect apps to ConfigServers and do not need to know the details of the internal nodes.\n\nTwo ConfigServers act as primary and standby.\nLive and available DataServer node information for the cluster is determined using a heartbeat check between the ConfigServer and DataServer.\nBased on the DataServer node information, the ConfigServer constructs a data distribution table which shows how data is distributed in the cluster.\nThe ConfigServer provides a data distribution table query service.\nThe ConfigServer schedules data migration and copying between DataServers.\n\nDataServers provide storage engines.\nDataServers receive operations initiated by clients, such as put/get/remove.\nDataServers migrate and copy data.\nDataServers provide access statistics.\n\nClients provide APIs for accessing the Tair cluster.\nClients update and cache data distribution tables.\nClients provide LocalCache to prevent overheated data access from affecting the Tair cluster service.\nClients control traffic.\n\nA distributed cluster architecture is used to provide automatic disaster recovery and failover.\nLoad balancing is supported and data is distributed evenly.\nSystem storage space and throughput performance can be scaled elastically, resolving data volume and QPS performance limitations.\nFully-featured and user-friendly access\nThe data structure is rich. Single level key-value structures and secondary indexing structures are supported.\nVarious uses are supported. Counter mode is also supported.\nData expiration and version control are supported.\n\nAs business volume increases, the number of concurrent requests to the database system is increasing and the load on the database system is becoming heavier. When the database system is overloaded, response speeds are slower and, in extreme situations, the service may even be interrupted. To address this problem, Tair MDB can be deployed together with database products to provide high throughput and low latency storage.\nMDB can respond quickly, and generally completes requests within milliseconds. Moreover, MDB supports a higher QPS rate and can process more concurrent requests than databases. By observing the business, the user can store hotspot data in MDB and significantly lessen the load on the database. This not only reduces database costs but also improves system availability.\n\nApplications such as social websites, e-commerce websites, games, and advertisements need to maintain a large volume of temporary data. Storing temporary data in MDB can reduce the memory management overheads and application load.\nIn a distributed environment, MDB can be used as uniform global storage which can prevent data loss caused by a single point of failure and resolve issues relating to synchronization between multiple applications.\nA common example is to use MDB as a session manager. If the website uses distributed deployment and the traffic is huge, different requests from the same user may be sent to different web servers. In this case, MDB can be used as a global storage solution to save session data, user tokens, permission information and other data.\n\nThe recommendation and advertising businesses generally need to compute huge amounts of data offline. LDB supports persistent storage and provides superb performance. Online services are supported, allowing the user to regularly import offline data to LDB for online services.\nAfter computing, list businesses can store the final lists in LDB to be directly displayed to front-end apps. In this way, LDB meets storage and high-speed access needs.\n\nSecurity apps have many blacklist/whitelist scenarios. These blacklist/whitelist scenarios are characterized by low hit rates, large access volumes, and business loss caused by data loss. LDB supports data persistence and high access volume, so it is widely used in these scenarios.\n\nDistributed locks are usually used to prevent data inconsistency and logical chaos caused by multi thread concurrence. Distributed locks can be implemented using Tair's version feature or computing function. Thanks to LBS's persistence, the locks aren't lost and can be released normally even if the service goes down.\n\nThe source code is available user the GPL version We are avtively looking for contributors so if you have any ideas, bug reports, or patchs you would like to contribute please do not hesitate to do so.\""

We hope to represent the full feature set of OpenTelemetry across its languages in the future.\n\nIf you'd like to help (**which we would love**), check out our [contributing guidance](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you'd like to extend this demo or maintain a fork of it, read our .\n\n\nYou can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for your preferred deployment method:\n\nFor detailed documentation, see [Demo Documentation][docs]. If you're curious about a specific feature, the [docs landing page][docs] can point you in the right direction.\n\n\nWe welcome any vendor to fork the project to demonstrate their services and adding a link below.

After closing the drive this will be false.\n\nNumber that indicates how many modifications were made, useful as a version identifier.\n\nBoolean indicating if the drive handles or not metadata. Always true.\n\nCreates a file at path in the drive. options are the same as in createWriteStream.\n\nReturns the blob at path in the drive. If no blob exists, returns null.\n\nIt also returns null for symbolic links.\n\noptions include:\n\nReturns the entry at path in the drive. It looks like this:\n\noptions include:\n\nReturns true if the entry at path does exists, otherwise false.\n\nDeletes the file at path from the drive.\n\nReturns 0 if entries are the same, 1 if entryA is older, and -1 if entryB is older.\n\nDeletes the blob from storage to free up space, but the file structure reference is kept.\n\noptions include:\n\nDeletes all the blobs from storage to free up space, similar to how drive.clear() works.\n\noptions include:\n\nTruncates the Hyperdrive to a previous version (both the file-structure reference and the blobs).\n\nA blobs: <length> option can be passed in if you know the corresponding blobs length, but it is recommended to let the method figure it out for you.\n\nPurge both cores (db and blobs) from your storage, completely removing all the drive's data.\n\nCreates an entry in drive at path that points to the entry at linkname.\n\nIf a blob entry currently exists at path then it will get overwritten and drive.get(key) will return null, while drive.entry(key) will return the entry with symlink information.\n\nUseful for atomically mutate the drive, has the same interface as Hyperdrive.\n\nCommit a batch of mutations to the underlying drive.\n\nReturns a stream of all entries in the drive at paths prefixed with folder.\n\noptions include:\n\nReturns a stream of all subpaths of entries in drive stored at paths prefixed by folder.\n\noptions include:\n\nReturns a read stream of entries in the drive.\n\noptions are the same as Hyperbee().createReadStream([range], [options]).\n\nEfficiently mirror this drive into another. Returns a Mirror instance constructed with options.\n\nCall await mirror.done() to wait for the mirroring to finish.\n\nReturns an iterator that listens on folder to yield changes, by default on /.\n\nUsage example:\n\nThose current and previous are snapshots that are auto-closed before next value.\n\nDon't close those snapshots yourself because they're used internally, let them be auto-closed.\n\nawait watcher.ready()\n\nWaits until the watcher is loaded and detecting changes.\n\nawait watcher.destroy()\n\nStops the watcher. You could also stop it by using break in the loop.\n\nReturns a stream to read out the blob stored in the drive at path.\n\noptions include:\n\nStream a blob into the drive at path.\n\noptions include:\n\nDownloads the blobs corresponding to all entries in the drive at paths prefixed by folder.\n\noptions are the same as those for drive.list(folder, [options]).\n\nGet a read-only snapshot of a previous version.\n\nEfficiently create a stream of the shallow changes to folder between version and drive.version.\n\nEach entry is sorted by key and looks like this:\n\nIf an entry exists in drive.version of the folder but not in version, then left is set and right will be null, and vice versa.\n\nDownloads all the blobs in folder corresponding to entries in drive.checkout(version) that are not in drive.version.\n\nIn other words, downloads all the blobs added to folder up to version of the drive.\n\nDownloads the entries and blobs stored in the ranges dbRanges and blobRanges.\n\nIndicate to Hyperdrive that you're finding peers in the background, requests will be on hold until this is done.\n\nCall done() when your current discovery iteration is done, i.e. after swarm.flush() finishes.\n\nUsage example:\n\nSee more about how replicate works at corestore.replicate[store-replicate-docs].\n\nWaits for initial proof of the new drive version until all findingPeers are done.\n\noptions include:\n\nUse drive.findingPeers() or { wait: true } to make await drive.update() blocking.\n\nReturns the Blobs instance storing the blobs indexed by drive entries.\n\n[core-range-docs]: https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore\n\n[store-replicate-docs]: https://github.com/holepunchto/corestore\n\nReturns the length of the Hyperblobs instance at the time of the specified Hyperdrive version (defaults to the current version).\n\nApache-2.0\""

Our hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a node, we can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.\n\nAurae deploys a memory-safe runtime daemon, process manager, and PID-1 initialization system to remotely schedule processes, containers, and virtual machines as well as set node configurations (e.g., like networking storage).\n\nThrough system proportioning and enterprise workload isolation techniques, the Aurae project can complement higher order schedulers and control planes (such as Kubernetes) as Aurae supports the usage of multi-tenant workloads and enterprise identities all the way down to the socket layer.\n\nSlides:  \nWebsite :  \n\n[![5a277u4j6fU](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5a277u4j6fU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a277u4j6fU)\n\n> **STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**  \n> **The Aurae project and API can change without notice.**  \n> **Do not run the project in production until further notice!**  \n> The Aurae project welcomes contributions of all kinds and sizes. Please read the \"[getting involved]\" documentation before contributing to the project.  \n> You do not have to know [Rust] to join the project.\n\nBy joining the project in its early stages, you will help to create a milestone contender for corporate distributed systems and automation that will remain accessible to anyone.\n\nBy introducing Aurae cells on top of a Linux kernel, the control of each internal runtime process on a given node becomes possible. The auraed runtime maintains ownership of every process by managing everything from PID-1 to nested processes.\n\nMaintainable and predefined .proto-files contribute to the core definition of the distributed systems runtime and the standard library. During the build process, these .proto-files can allow for greater customization possibilities. The TypeScript file format replaces static manifests (like the YAML file format) for direct interactions with a running system.\n\n| **Auraed** | To ensure memory safety, Aurae serves the generic system's runtime daemon (auraed). |\n| **AuraeScript** | The AuraeScript (a Turing-complete scripting language built on TypeScript) library automatically generates itself from the pre-defined .proto files defined in the Aurae standard library. It also directly embeds Deno source code to provide an SDK and the functionality to attach remote clients for the direct remote communication with Aurae. |\n\n| **Authentication** | Aurae extends SPIFFE/SPIRE (x509 mTLS)-backed identity, authentication (authn), and authorization (authz) in a distributed system down to the Unix domain socket layer. |\n| **Principle of Least Awareness** | A single Aurae instance has no awareness of higher order scheduling mechanisms such as the Kubernetes control plane. |\n| **Runtime Workloads** | The Aurae runtime API can manage virtual machines, executables, cells, pods, and other spawned Aurae instances. |\n| **The Aurae Standard Library** | The Aurae project exposes its functionality as a gRPC API through the Aurae standard library. The V0 API reference contains the current library definition. |\n\n[^memory-safe]: The reliability and effectiveness of the Rust systems language make it an excellent choice for the development of the Aurae project. [Learn more about Rust]\n\n[^cells]: Additionally, with Aurae cells, the project provides various ways to partition and slice up systems allowing for isolation strategies in enterprise workloads.\n\n[^compare]: As a low-level building block, the Aurae Project works well with any higher-order system by offering a thoughtful set of API calls and controls for managing workloads on a single node.\n\n[^medium]: Learn more from the [Medium Blog: Why fix Kubernetes and Systemd?] by [Kris Nóva]).\n\n[workflow in progress: deploy]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/291-deploy-website-documentation-aurae-builder-make-docs.yml/badge.svg?branch=main \"https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/291-deploy-website-documentation-aurae-builder-make-docs.yml\"\n[workflow in progress: documentation]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/290-check-website-documentation-aurae-builder-make-docs.yml/badge.svg \"https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/290-check-website-documentation-aurae-builder-make-docs.yml\"\n[workflow in progress: build]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/001-tester-ubuntu-make-test.yml/badge.svg \"https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/actions/workflows/001-tester-ubuntu-make-test.yml\"\n\n[aurae cells]: https://aurae.io/blog/24-10-2022-aurae-cells/ \"Learn more about Aurae cells\"\n[aurae standard library]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/ \"Learn more about Auraes standard library\"\n[aurae]: https://aurae.io/ \"Visit aurae.io\"\n[cells]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/\n[executables]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/\n[getting involved]: https://aurae.io/community/\n[pods]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/\n[spawned aurae instances]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/\n[v0 api reference]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/ \"Learn more about the current Aurae library definitions\"\n[virtual machines]: https://aurae.io/stdlib/v0/\n[introducing aurae cells]: https://aurae.io/blog/2022-10-24-aurae-cells/\n\n[grpc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC \"Read about gRPC\"\n[mtls]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication\n[pid]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier \"Read about PID\"\n\n[auraescript]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/tree/main/auraescript \"Check out the Auraescript on Github 🌟\"\n[containerd]: https://github.com/containerd/containerd \"Read about containerd on GH\"\n[firecracker]: https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker \"Read about firecracker on Github\"\n[kris nóva]: https://github.com/krisnova \"Check out Kris Nóva on Github 🌟\"\n[open-source]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae/blob/main/LICENSE \"Apache License 2.0\"\n[spiffe]: https://github.com/spiffe \"Read about SPIFFE\"\n[spire]: https://github.com/spiffe/spire \"Read about SPIRE\"\n\n[.proto]: https://protobuf.dev/ \"Read more about Protocol Buffers\"\n[deno]: https://deno.land \"Read more about Deno\"\n[learn more about rust]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ \"The book about the Rust programming language\"\n[linux kernel]: https://git.kernel.org/ \"Learn about the Linux kernels\"\n[medium blog: why fix kubernetes and systemd?]: https://medium.com/@kris-nova/why-fix-kubernetes-and-systemd-782840e50104 \"Learn more about the possibilies of Aurae\"\n[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/ \"Read and learn more about the Rust language\"\n[systemd]: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ \"Read more about Systemd\"\n[typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/ \"Read more about TypeScript\"\n[yaml]: https://yaml.org/ \"Read more about YAML\"\""

Written in node.js, hosted at https://login.persona.org.\n\nThe Persona Remote Verification Service:\nA stateless node.js server which handles cryptographic verification of identity assertions. Hosted at verifier.login.persona.org, but easy to run locally.\n\nThe Cross-Browser Persona Support Library:\nThe include.js file that provides the navigator.id API for browsers without native support for Persona. This also includes the code for the dialog shown to users of those browsers.\n\nSample and Test Code:\nFor all of the above.\n\nThe Persona team uses Git and GitHub for all of our development and issue tracking. If you'd like to contribute code back to us, please do so using a Pull Request. If you get stuck and need help, you can find the core team on our public mailing list or in\n\nPull Request\ndev-identity\n\nBrowserID needs the following dependencies before it can run:\n\nnode.js (>= 0.8.11)\nlibgmp3\ng+\n\nFor detailed instructions for your specific operating system, check out the SETUP docs in the docs/ folder.\n\nTo run the BrowserID service locally:\n\nClone the repository to your machine.\nRun npm install from the root of your clone.\nRun npm start from the root of your clone.\n\nWhen you run npm start, it will print several URLs to your terminal. You can test that everything is working by visiting the URL for the example (RP) site. Look for a line like this in the terminal:\n\nexample (10361): running on http://127.0.0.1:10001\n\nYou can stop the services by typing Control-C in the terminal.\n\nTo stay up to date with BrowserID:\n\nUse git pull to retrieve new changes.\nDelete both the var and node_modules folders in the root of your local clone.\nRun npm install from the root of your local clone.\n\nUnit tests can be run by invoking npm test at the top level. At present, there are three classes of unit tests to be run:\n\nBackend unit tests against a custom, zero-dependency JSON database.\nBackend unit tests against MySQL, what we use in production.\nFrontend unit tests run headlessly against PhantomJS.\n\nYou can control which tests are run using the WHAT_TESTS env var, see scripts/test for details.\n\nIntegration tests are done with Travis-CI. It is recommended that you setup Travis-CI for your BrowserID fork so that tests are automatically run when you push changes. This will give the BrowserID team confidence that your changes both function correctly and do not cause regressions in other parts of the code.

It is easy to deploy and maintain, highly reliable, fault tolerant, highly performing, easily scalable and POSIX compliant.\n\nMooseFS spreads data over a number of commodity servers, which are visible to the user as one resource. For standard file operations MooseFS acts like ordinary Unix-like file system:\n\nA hierarchical structure – directory tree  \nStores POSIX file attributes – permissions, last access and modification times, etc.  \nSupports ACLs  \nSupports POSIX and BSD file locks – including support for distributed file locking  \nSupports special files – block and character devices, pipes and sockets  \nSupports symbolic links – file names pointing to target files, not necessarily on MooseFS  \nSupports hard links – different names of files which refer to the same data on MooseFS\n\nDistinctive MooseFS features:\n\nHigh reliability – files are stored in several copies on separate servers. The number of copies is a configurable parameter, even per each file  \nNo Single Point of Failure – all hardware and software components may be redundant  \nParallel data operations – many clients can access many files concurrently  \nCapacity can be dynamically expanded by simply adding new servers/disks on the fly  \nRetired hardware may be removed on the fly Deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time (a file system level \"trash bin\")  \nCoherent, \"atomic\" snapshots of files, even while the files are being written/accessed  \nAccess to the file system can be limited based on IP address and/or password (similarly as in NFS)  \nData tiering – supports different storage policies for different files/directories in Storage Classes mechanism  \nPer-directory, \"project\" quotas – configurable per RAW space, usable space, number of inodes with hard and soft quotas support\n\nApart from file system storage, MooseFS also provides block storage (`mfsbdev`)  \nEfficient, pure C implementation  \nEthernet support\n\nMooseFS can be installed on any POSIX compliant operating system including various Linux distributions, FreeBSD and macOS:\n\nUbuntu  \nDebian  \nRHEL / CentOS  \nOpenSUSE  \nFreeBSD  \nmacOS\n\nMooseFS Client uses FUSE library, available for:  and .\n\nThere is a separate MooseFS Client for Microsoft Windows available, built on top of .\n\nYou can install MooseFS using your favourite package manager on one of the following platforms using :\n\nUbuntu 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24  \nDebian 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13  \nRHEL / CentOS 7 / 8 / 9  \nFreeBSD 11 / 12 / 13 / 14  \nmacOS 10.12Ubuntu 20 / 22 – Raspberry Pi  \nDebian 11 / 12 – Raspberry Pi\n\nPackages for CentOS 6 are also available, but no longer supported.\n\nDebian packages are compatible with Proxmox.\nCentOS packages are compatible with Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux and openSUSE Leap.\n\nMinimal set of packages, which are needed to run MooseFS:\n\n`moosefs-master` MooseFS Master Server for metadata servers,  \n`moosefs-chunkserver` MooseFS Chunkserver for data storage servers,  \n`moosefs-client` MooseFS Client – client side package to mount the filesystem.\n\nFeel free to download the source code from our GitHub code repository!\n\nInstall the following dependencies before building MooseFS from sources:\n\nDebian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse3-dev pkg-config`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse-dev pkg-config`)\nCentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install gcc make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse3-devel pkgconfig`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo yum install gcc make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse-devel pkgconfig`)\n\nRecommended packages:\n\nDebian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install fuse3`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo apt install fuse`)\nCentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install fuse3`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo yum install fuse`)\n\nBuilding MooseFS on Linux can be easily done by running `./linux_build.sh`. Similarly, use `./freebsd_build.sh` in order to build MooseFS on FreeBSD and respectively `./macosx_build.sh` on macOS. Remember that these scripts do not install binaries (i.e. do not run `make install`) at the end. Run this command manually.\n\nJust three steps to have MooseFS up and running:\n\nInstall `moosefs-master` package  \nPrepare default config (as `root`):\n\nPrepare the metadata file (as `root`):\n\nRun Master Server (as `root`): `mfsmaster start`\nMake this machine visible under `mfsmaster` name, e.g. by adding a DNS entry (recommended) or by adding it in `/etc/hosts` on all servers that run any of MooseFS components.\n\nInstall `moosefs-chunkserver` package  \nPrepare default config (as `root`):\n\nAt the end of `mfshdd.cfg` file make one or more entries containing paths to HDDs / partitions designated for storing chunks, e.g.:\n\nIt is recommended to use XFS as an underlying filesystem for disks designated to store chunks. More than two Chunkservers are strongly recommended. \n\nChange the ownership and permissions to `mfs:mfs` to above mentioned locations:\n\nStart the Chunkserver: `mfschunkserver start`\n\nRepeat steps above for second (third, ...) Chunkserver.\n\nInstall `moosefs-client` package  \nMount MooseFS (as `root`):\n\nor: `mfsmount -H mfsmaster /mnt/mfs` if the above method is not supported by your system\n\nYou can also add an `/etc/fstab` entry to mount MooseFS during the system boot:\n\nThere are more configuration parameters available but most of them may stay with defaults. We do our best to keep MooseFS easy to deploy and maintain.\n\nMooseFS, for testing purposes, can even be installed on a single machine!\n\nSetting up `moosefs-cli` or `moosefs-cgi` with `moosefs-cgiserv` is also recommended – it gives you a possibility to monitor the cluster online:\n\nInstall `moosefs-cli moosefs-cgi moosefs-cgiserv` packages (they are typically set up on the Master Server)\nRun MooseFS CGI Server (as `root`): `mfscgiserv start`\nOpen http://mfsmaster:9425 in your web browser\n\nIt is also strongly recommended to set up at least one Metalogger on a different machine than Master Server (e.g. on one of Chunkservers). Metalogger constantly synchronizes and backups the metadata:\n\nInstall `moosefs-metalogger` package\nPrepare default config (as `root`):\n\nRun Metalogger (as `root`): `mfsmetalogger start`\n\nRefer to  for more details.\n\nDate of the first public release: 2008-05-30\nThe project web site: https://moosefs.com\nInstallation and using MooseFS: https://moosefs.com/support\n(Old) Sourceforge project site: https://sourceforge.net/projects/moosefs\n\nReporting bugs:  or \nGeneral: \n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2024 Jakub Kruszona-Zawadzki, Saglabs SA\n\nThis file is part of MooseFS.\n\nMooseFS is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 2 (only).\n\nMooseFS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Stateright is an actor library that aims to solve this problem by providing an embedded [model checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking), a UI for exploring system behavior (), and a lightweight actor runtime. It also features a linearizability tester that can be run within the model checker for more exhaustive test coverage than similar solutions such as .\n\nPlease see the book, \"[Building Distributed Systems With Stateright](https://www.stateright.rs).\" A [video introduction](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUhyBsVvEJjaF1VpNhLRfIA4E7CFPirmz) is also available. Stateright also has detailed documentation. Consider also joining the [Stateright Discord server](https://discord.gg/JbxGSVP4A6) for Q&A or other feedback.\n\nStateright includes a variety of examples, such as a [Single Decree Paxos cluster](https://github.com/stateright/stateright/blob/master/examples/paxos.rs) and an [abstract two phase commit model](https://github.com/stateright/stateright/blob/master/examples/2pc.rs).\n\nPassing a `check` CLI argument causes each example to validate itself using Stateright's model checker:\n\n```\ncheck\n```\n\nPassing an `explore` CLI argument causes each example to spin up the Stateright Explorer web UI locally on port 3000, allowing you to browse system behaviors:\n\n```\nexplore\n```\n\nPassing a `spawn` CLI argument to the examples leveraging the actor functionality will cause each to spawn actors using the included runtime, transmitting JSON messages over UDP:\n\n```\nspawn\n```\n\nThe `bench.sh` script runs all the examples with various settings for benchmarking the performance impact of changes to the library.\n\nStateright contains a general purpose model checker offering:\n\n- Invariant checks via \"always\" properties.\n- Nontriviality checks via \"sometimes\" properties.\n- Liveness checks via \"eventually\" properties (experimental/incomplete).\n- A web browser UI for interactively exploring state space.\n- Linearizability testers.\n- Support for symmetry reduction to reduce state spaces.\n\nStateright's actor system features include:\n\n- An actor runtime that can execute actors outside the model checker in the \"real world.\"\n- A model for lossy/lossless duplicating/non-duplicating networks with the ability to capture actor message delivery to check an actor system against an expected consistency model.\n- Pluggable network semantics for model checking, allowing you to choose between fewer assumptions (e.g. \"lossy unordered duplicating\") or more assumptions (speeding up model checking; e.g. \"lossless ordered\").\n- An optional network adapter that provides a lossless non-duplicating ordered virtual channel for messages between a pair of actors.\n\nIn contrast with other actor libraries, Stateright enables you to [formally verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) the correctness of your implementation, and in contrast with model checkers such as TLC for distributed systems, systems implemented using Stateright can also be run on a real network without being reimplemented in a different language.\n\nContributions are welcome!

Shadow co-opts the native processes into a discrete-event simulation by\ninterposing at the system call API.

Shadow internally implements simulated versions of common network protocols\n(e.g., TCP and UDP). Shadow internally models network routing characteristics (e.g., path latency\nand packet loss) using a configurable network graph.\n\nNetwork emulators (e.g., ) run real application\ncode on top of real OS kernels in real time, but are non-deterministic and have\nlimited scalability: time distortion can occur if emulated processes exceed an\nunknown computational threshold, leading to undefined behavior.\n\nNetwork simulators (e.g., ) offer more experimental\ncontrol and scalability, but have limited application-layer realism because they\nrun application abstractions in place of real application code.\n\nShadow offers a novel, hybrid emulation/simulation architecture: it directly\nexecutes real applications as native OS processes in order to faithfully\nreproduce application-layer behavior while also co-opting the processes into a\nhigh-performance network simulation that can scale to large distributed systems\nwith hundreds of thousands of processes.\n\nShadow implements over 150 functions from the system call API, but does not\nyet fully support all API features. Although applications that make _basic_ use\nof the supported system calls should work out of the box, those that use more\n_complex_ features or functions may not yet function correctly when running in\nShadow.

Major features as\n\nFault-Tolerance: The distributed training can continue running in the event of failures.\nFlash Checkpoint: The distributed training can recover failures from the in-memory checkpoint in seconds.\nAuto-Scaling: The distributed training can scale up/down resources to improve the stability, throughput\nand resource utilization.\n\n\n\nDLRover can restore the training when the process fails without stopping the\ntraining job. The actions to restore training in DLRover are:\n\nAutomatically diagnose the failure reason.\nRestart the process not the node due to software errors.\nRestart the failed nodes due to hardward errors.\n\nFor detail, we can see the .\nWith fault tolerance, the goodput of GLM-65B training\non thousands of GPUs increased from 69% to 95%**. The goodput is the time spent computing\nuseful new steps over the elapsed time of the training job.\nThe downtime details are shown:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/figures/dlrover-goodput-performance.jpg\" alt=\"Editor\" width=\"600\">\n</div>\n\n\n\nIn addition to fault tolerance, DLRover provides the  to\nsave/load checkpoint in seconds. With flash checkpoint, the training can\nfrequently save checkpoints and reduce the roll-back step to resume training\nfrom the latest checkpoint when a failure happens. The features of flash checkpoint are:\n\nAsynchronously persist the checkpoint to the storage.\nPersist the checkpoint to the storage once the training process fails.\nLoad the checkpoint from the host memory after the training process restarts.\nAPIs for DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM().\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/figures/ft_llm_training/checkpoint_save_time.png\" alt=\"Editor\" width=\"396\">\n<img src=\"docs/figures/ft_llm_training/checkpoint_load_time.jpg\" alt=\"Editor\" width=\"400\">\n\n<text> The Performance of DLRover Flash Checkpoint to Save/Load GPT2-1.5B.</text>\n</div>\n\nThe figure illustrates that the I/O time of different DL frameworks to read checkpoint files\nwhen resuming training processes. With DLRover Flash Checkpoint,\nrecovery could be completed in the order of seconds by loading checkpoints directly from shared memory,\nwhich is much faster compared to loading checkpoints from SSD and NAS.\n\n\n\nDLRover can recover failed parameter servers and workers to resume training.\n\nDLRover can automatically launch a Pod with more memory to recover the OOM node.\nDLRover can reassign the training data of a failed worker to other workers.\nDLRover can automatically scale up the parameter servers to fit the model size.\n\nIn AntGroup, DLRover manages hundreds of DL training jobs every day on the customized Kubernetes cluster in AntGroup.\nExcept for the failed job resulting from code errors, **the rate of completed jobs increase from 89%\nwith tf-operator in KubeFlow to 95%**. Other unrecoverable failure reasons of a job are data error,\nNaN loss of the model, network breakdown, and so on.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/figures/job-complete-rate.png\" alt=\"Editor\" width=\"600\">\n</div>\n\n\n\nDLRover automatically scales up/down resources (for parameter servers or workers) at the runtime of a training job.\nBy monitoring the workload of nodes and throughput, DLRover can diagnose the bottleneck of the resource configuration.\nThe common bottleneck contains node straggler, the unbalanced workload of PS, insufficient CPU cores of nodes,\nand the insufficient number of nodes. DLRover can improve the training performance by dynamic resource adjustment.\n\nIn order to improve the training througphput, users prefer to\nconfigure their jobs with over-provision resources to\navoid any potential risk from insufficient resources.\nThis usually ends up in huge resource waste. DLRover Auto-Scaling\ncan allocate resources by the demand of model training to reduce\nthe waste of resources.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/figures/daily-job-resource-util.png\" alt=\"Editor\" width=\"1000\">\n</div>\n\n\n\nDynamic data sharding splits the dataset into many small shards and each shard only\ncontains a few batches of training samples. The worker will get a shard only when it using up\nsamples of the last one. With the dynaic sharding, DLRover can\n\nrecover the shard if the worker fails before using up samples of the shard.\nmitigate the worker straggler by assigning more shards to the fast worker.\n\n\n\nWith the data source transparency provided by dynamic data sharding, DLRover can be integrated with\noffline training which consumes batch data, and also supports online learning with real-time streaming data.\n(fed with a message queue like RocketMQ/Kafka/Pulsar/...,\nor executed as a training sink node inside Flink/Spark/Ray/...)\n\nBy practice, DLRover is an ideal component to build an end-to-end industrial online learning system,\n provides a detailed example implemented with `tf.estimator.Estimator`.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use `dlrover-run` to run the training script which\n`torchrun` or `torch.distributed.run` can run.\n\n\n\nThe more detail tutorials are:\n\nto\nsupport elasticity and fault tolerance of Pod on k8s.\nto check the fault or slow node in a distributed job.\nto speed up checkpoint during training.\n\n\n\nWe can use DLRover to train a TensorFlow by the following steps:\n\nUse TensorFlow estimator to develop the TensorFlow model.\nDefine the input of `tf.dataset` in a training configuration of DLRover.\nDefine your reader to read samples from the dataset file.\n\nWe can refer to the  to train\na model with DLRover.\n\n\n\nMulti-node in-memory redundant backup checkpoint to fast failure recovery.\nFine-grained automatic distributed training for GPU Synchronous jobs\n  hybrid-parallel mode\n  adapted hyper parameters adjustment with dynamic resources\n  more strategies for Fine-grained scenarioes\nFull stack solution for Online Deep Learning\nHigh performance extension library for Tensorflow/Pytorch to speed up training\n...\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the \""

It has a microkernel for pluggable components, including applications, distributed frameworks, devops tools, and local runtime/resource providers, enabling their independent development and seamless integration. The project was originally developed for Microsoft Bing, and now has been adopted in production both inside and outside Microsoft.\n\nRocksDB made replicated using rDSN!\nA one-box cluster demo to understand how rDSN helps service registration, deployment, monitoring etc..\nBuild a counter service with built-in tools (e.g., codegen, auto-test, fault injection, bug replay, tracing)\nBuild a scalable and reliable counter service with built-in replication support\n\nThe core of rDSN is a service kernel with which we can develop (via  and ) and plugin lots of different application, framework, tool, and local runtime modules, so that they can seamlessly benefit each other. Here is an incomplete list of the pluggable modules.\n\n| Pluggable modules | Description | Release |\n|--------|-------------|------|\n|  | rDSN service kernel |  | \n|       | scale-out and fail-over for stateless services (e.g., micro services) |  |\n|  | scale-out, replicate, and fail-over for stateful services (e.g., storage) |  |\n|     | membership, load balance, and machine pool management for the above service frameworks |  |\n|            | a client-side helper module that resolves service URL to target machine |  |\n|          | fine-grain RPC request routing/splitting/forking to multiple services (e.g., A/B test) | todo |\n                 | deployment runtime (e.g., network, aio, lock, timer, perf counters, loggers) for both Windows and Linux; simple toollets, such as tracer, profiler, and fault-injector |  |\n                    | an implementation of remote file copy based on rpc and aio |  |\n               | an emulation runtime for whole distributed system emulation with auto-test, replay, global state checking, etc. |  |\n                    | high performance counterparts for the modules as implemented in tools.common | todo |\n               | extracts task-level dependencies automatically |  |\n            | collect critical logs (e.g., log-level >= WARNING) in cluster |  |\n                     | an example application module |  | \n\n\nrDSN provides flexible configuration so that developers can combine and configure the modules differently to enable different scenarios. All modules are loaded by , a common process runner in rDSN, with the given configuration file. The following table lists some examples (note **dsn.core*is always required therefore omitted in  column).\n\n| Scenarios | Modules  | Config | Demo | \n|----------|---------------|--------|------|\n| logic correctness development | dsn.app.simple_kv dsn.tools.emulator dsn.tools.common |   | todo |\n| logic correctness with failure | dsn.app.simple_kv dsn.tools.emulator dsn.tools.common |   | todo |\n| performance tuning | dsn.app.simple_kv dsn.tools.common |   | todo |\n| progressive performance tuning | dsn.app.simple_kv dsn.tools.common dsn.tools.emulator |   | todo |\n| Paxos enabled stateful service | dsn.app.simple_kv dsn.tools.common dsn.tools.emulator dsn.dist.uri.resolver dsn.dist.serivce.meta_server dsn.dist.service.stateful.type1 |   | todo |\n\nThere are a lot more possibilities. rDSN provides a  to enable quick deployment of these scenarios in a cluster, and allow easy operations through simple clicks as well as rich visualization. Deployment scenarios are defined , and developers can add more on demand. \n\n\nreduced system complexity via microkernel architecture\napplications, frameworks (e.g., replication, scale-out, fail-over), local runtime libraries (e.g., network libraries, locks), and tools are all pluggable modules into a microkernel to enable independent development and seamless integration (therefore modules are reusable and transparently benefit each other)\n\n\nflexible configuration with global deploy-time view\ntailor the module instances and their connections on demand with configurable system complexity and resource allocation (e.g., run all nodes in one simulator for testing, allocate CPU resources appropriately for avoiding resource contention, debug with progressively added system complexity)\n\n\ntransparent tooling support\ndedicated tool API for tool development; built-in plugged tools for understanding, testing, debugging, and monitoring the upper applications and frameworks\n\n\nauto-handled distributed system challenges\nbuilt-in frameworks to achieve scalability, reliability, availability, and consistency etc. for the applications\n\n\nrDSN borrows the idea in many research work, from both our own and the others, and tries to make them real in production in a coherent way; we greatly appreciate the researchers who did these work.\n\nHotOS'13, SOSP'01, MSR Tech Report, Eurosys'14, MSR Tech Report, NSDI'08, NSDI'09, USENIX ATC'11, OSDI'08, HotOS'05\n\n\nrDSN is provided on Windows and Linux, with the MIT open source license.

Kingbus has the following key features:\n\nMySQL replication protocol compatibility, pull the binlog files from the master through gtid mode, and push the binlog file to slave through gtid mode.\n\nGeo-Replication, kingbus uses Raft to support Geo-Replication. The binlog data written to the cluster is guaranteed to be consistent between multiple nodes, and the order of binlog event is exactly the same as that on the master.\n\nHigh availability, your mysql binlog replication is always on and continuously available with kingbus.\n\nIn a traditional MySQL replication setup a single master server is created and a set of slaves of MySQL servers are configured to pull the binlog files from the master, putting a lot of load on the master.\n\nIntroducing a layer between the master server and the slave servers can reduce the load on the master by only serving kingbus instead of all the slaves.\n\nThe slaves will only need to be aware of kingbus and not the real master server. Removing the requirement for the slaves to have knowledge of the master also simplifies the process of replacing a failed master within a replication environment.\n\nKingbus allows us to horizontally scale our slaves without fear of overloading the network interface of the master\n\nKingbus can also be used to avoide deep nested replication on remote sites, with kingbus you don't need e deeply nested replication.\n\nThe size of the binlog storage space on the Master can be reduced, and store the binlog in kingbus.\n\nSupport MYSQL database heterogeneous log based replication.

Compare that with a request direct to the website: `time curl -v www.onegeek.com.au` it should be approximately 5s faster.\n\nThat's it. Running Muxy is a matter of configuring one or more plugins, with 1 or more components defined in a simple YAML file.\n\n\n\nCreate an application\nBuild in fault tolerance (e.g. using something like Hystrix)\nCreate integration tests\nRun Muxy configuring a `proxy` such as HTTP, and one or more `symptom`s such as network latency, partition, or HTTP error\nPoint your app at Muxy\nRun tests and check if system behaved as expected\nProfit!\n\n\n\nMuxy is a stateful system, and mucks with your low-level (system) networking interfaces and therefore cannot be run in parallel with other tests.\nIt is also recommended to run within a container/virtual machine to avoid unintended consequences (like breaking Internet access from the host).\n\nSimple HTTP(s) Proxy that starts up on a local IP/Hostname and Port.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nproxy:\n  type: http\n  host: 0.0.0.0\n  port: 8181\n  routes:\n    - path: /some/endpoint\n      target: http://backend:8080\n```\n\nSimple TCP Proxy that starts up on a local IP/Hostname and Port, forwarding traffic to the specified `proxy_host` on `proxy_port`.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nproxy:\n  type: tcp\n  host: 0.0.0.0\n  port: 8181\n  proxy_host: backend\n  proxy_port: 8080\n```\n\nMiddleware have the ability to intervene upon receiving a request (Pre-Dispatch) or before sending the response back to the client (Post-Dispatch).\nIn some cases, such as the Network Shaper, the effect is applied _before any request is made_ (e.g. if the local network device configuration is altered).\n\nA basic middleware that simply adds a delay of `delay` milliseconds to the request or response.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nmiddleware:\n  - type: delay\n    delay: 1000\n```\n\nA Layer 7 tamperer, this plugin allows you to modify response headers, status code, or the body itself.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nmiddleware:\n  - type: tamper\n    headers:\n      X-Foo: Bar\n    status_code: 200\n    body: \"Modified response body\"\n```\n\nThe network shaper plugin is a Layer 4 tamperer, and requires _root access_ to work, as it needs to configure the local firewall and network devices.\nUsing the excellent `iptables` library, it can shape and interfere with network traffic, including bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and jitter on specified ports, IPs, and protocols.\n\nNOTE: This component only works on MacOSX, FreeBSD, Linux, and common *nix flavours.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nmiddleware:\n  - type: network-shaper\n    bandwidth: 100Mbps\n    latency: 20ms\n    packet_loss: 1%\n```\n\nThe TCP Tamperer is a Layer 5 tamperer, modifying the messages in and around TCP sessions. Crudely, you can set the body of inbound and outbound TCP packets, truncate the last character of messages, or randomise the text over the wire.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nmiddleware:\n  - type: tcp-tamper\n    inbound_body: \"Inbound tampered body\"\n    outbound_body: \"Outbound tampered body\"\n```\n\nLog the in/out messages, optionally requesting the output to be hex encoded.\n\nExample configuration snippet:\n\n```yaml\nmiddleware:\n  - type: logger\n    hex_encode: true\n```\n\nRefer to the `config.yml` file for a full reference.\n\n\n\nUsing the `github.com/mefellows/muxy` library, we use Muxy to trigger a circuit breaker and return a canned response, ensuring we don't have downtime. View the `circuit-breaker` example.\n\n\n\nDownload the binary by running:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://github.com/mefellows/muxy/releases/download/v0.1.0/muxy_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o muxy.tar.gz\ntar -xzf muxy.tar.gz\nsudo mv muxy /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nAfter creating a `config.yml`, and assuming you are proxying something on port `80`, you can now run the image locally:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name muxy-proxy muxy:latest\n```\n\nYou should now be able to hit this Docker container and simulate any failures as per usual. e.g. `curl docker:80/some/endpoint`.\n\nThe `docker-compose` example above has a detailed example on how to use Muxy with a more complicated system, using Docker Compose to orchestrate a number of containers.\n\n\n\nMuxy is built as a series of configurable plugins (using `github.com/mefellows/plugin`) that must be specified in the configuration file to be activated. Start with a quick tour of Plugo before progressing.\n\n\n\nProxies must implement the `github.com/mefellows/muxy/proxy` interface, and register themselves via `PluginFactories.register` to be available at runtime.\nTake a look at the `muxy-proxy` example for a good working example.\n\n\n\nMiddlewares implement the `github.com/mefellows/muxy/middleware` interface and register themselves via `PluginFactories.register` to be available at runtime.\nTake a look at the `muxy-middleware` example for a good working example.\n\n\n\nSee the `examples` directory.\""

Your task is to extract exactly 10 single or a maximum of two-word keywords from the provided README content. These keywords should represent the core focus, technologies, and unique contributions of the repository. Follow these rules: 1. Extract only unique keywords, AVOIDING PHRASES and LONG DESCRIPTIONS. 2. Provide only a clean, numbered list of 10 complete, concise keywords. NO EXPLANATIONS, HEADERS, SPECIAL CHARACTERS or extra formatting. 3. Ensure each keyword is concise, no longer than two words. Avoid abbreviations, truncated terms, or excessive technical jargon unless they directly represent the core contribution. 4.

Give it a try for yourself!\n\nBytecode Viewer (BCV) is an Advanced Lightweight Java/Android Reverse Engineering Suite. Powered by several open source tools BCV is designed to aid in the reversing process.\n\nBCV comes with 6 decompilers, 3 disassemblers, 2 assemblers, 2 APK converters, advanced searching, debugging & more.\n\nIt's written completely in Java, and it's open sourced. It's currently being maintained and developed by Konloch.\n\nPlease note this demo is from a very old version\n\nDownload the latest version from https://github.com/konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases and run the Bytecode-Viewer-2.10.x.jar.\nYou may need to execute it via command line  (replace the X with the current minor version)\n\nStarting with a Jar, Zip, ClassFile or Android file (APK, DEX, XAPK, etc) drag it into BCV. It will start the decoding process automatically.\nFrom here you can select the decompilers you would like to use by selecting the View Pane>View 1, View 2, View 3, etc.\nThe view panes are-used to display up to 3 decompilers side by side, you can also toggle edibility here.\nSelect the resource you would like to open by navigating using the resource list, BCV will do its best to display it (Decompiling, Disassembling, etc).\nYou can use plugins to help you search along with using the search pane in the left-hand bottom corner.\n\nThere is also a plugin system that will allow you to interact with the loaded classfiles. You could for example write a String deobfuscator, a malicious code searcher, or anything else you can think of.\n\nYou can either use one of the pre-written plugins, or write your own. The plugin system supports java and javascript scripting.\n\nOnce a plugin is activated, it will execute the plugin with a ClassNode ArrayList of every single class loaded in BCV, this allows the user to handle it completely using ASM.\n\n\n\nJust clone this repo and run ``mvn package``. It's that simple!\n\nOpen the Maven project (e.g. in IntelliJ, open the ``pom.xml`` as a project file).\n\nChange the theme to your systems. Go into `View->Visual Settings->Window Theme` and select `System Theme`.\n\nStart BCV with more RAM, e.g. `java -Xmx3G -jar BCV.jar`\n\nRight click on the jar file, go to Properties, and select Unblock under Security at the bottom of the General tab.\n\nRun BCV as administrator.\n\nJoin The Bytecode Club Today! https://the.bytecode.club\""

The content here contains lots of scripts and copy-n-paste commands to enable you to quickly address your needs.\n\nThis repo is an ongoing brain dump of my experiences training Large Language Models (LLM) (and VLMs). A lot of the know-how I acquired while training the open-source model in 2022 and the multi-modal model in 2023, and RAG models, is being compiled mostly for myself so that I could quickly find solutions I have already researched and which have worked. However, as usual, I'm happy to share these notes with the wider ML community.\n\n**Part Insights**: What you need to know in order to succeed.\n\n**Part Hardware**: Accelerators, CPUs, CPU memory. Local, distributed, and shared file systems. Intra- and inter-node networking.\n\n**Part Orchestration**: The main orchestration environment.\n\n**Part Training**: Model training-related guides.\n\n**Part Inference**: Model inference insights.\n\n**Part Development**: How to debug easy and difficult issues. Numerous tips and tools to make test writing enjoyable.\n\n**Part Miscellaneous**: LLM/VLM chronicles.\n\nI announce any significant updates on my Twitter channel.\n\nDownload the version of the book.\n\nI will try to rebuild it once a week or so, but if you want the latest, the instructions for building are available.\n\nThanks to HuggingFace for giving me permission to host my book's PDF at the HuggingFace website.\n\nIf you want to discuss something related to ML engineering, this repo has the discussion available. Please don't hesitate to share your experience or start a new discussion about something you're passionate about.\n\nHigh-end accelerators:\n\nNetworks:\n\nThings that you are likely to need to find quickly and often.\n\nTools:\n\n- A much easier way to benchmark network throughput than nccl-tests.\n- A tool to quickly test your inter-node connectivity.\n\nGuides:\n\n- Quick copy-n-paste solutions to resolve hanging or breaking PyTorch applications.\n- A Slurm cheatsheet and tricks.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without being entrusted with doing the specific LLM/VLM trainings I have learned the initial know-how from. This is a privilege that only a few enjoy due to the prohibitively expensive cost of renting huge ML compute clusters. So, hopefully, the rest of the ML community will vicariously learn from these notes.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Jeff Dean who proposed that I lead the BLOOM-176B training back when I didn't know anything about large-scale training. This was the project that catapulted me into the intense learning process. And, of course, HuggingFace for giving me the opportunity to work full-time on BLOOM-176B and later on IDEFICS-80B trainings.\n\nRecently, I continued expanding my knowledge and experience while training models and building scalable training/inference systems at Meta and I'm grateful to that opportunity.\n\nI'd also like to say thanks to the numerous contributors who have been making this text awesome and error-free.\n\nIf you found a bug, typo, or would like to propose an improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or contribute a PR.\n\nThe content of this site is distributed under an open-source license.\n\n✔ **Machine Learning:**\n  |\n \n✔ **Guides:**\n  |\n \n✔ **Applications:**\n  |\n \n✔ **Tools and Cheatsheets:**\""

When a , support for that version is dropped from Kedro. This is not considered a breaking change.\nThe  package follows the  Python version support policy. This means that `kedro-datasets` generally drops Python version support before `kedro`. This is because `kedro-datasets` has a lot of dependencies that follow NEP 29 and the more conservative version support approach of the Kedro Framework makes it hard to manage those dependencies properly.\n\n\n\n\nWe appreciate our community and want to stay connected.

Please use the information provided as a baseline and feel free adjust it to your needs.\n\nThe framework relies heavily on radar charts to visually represent the different perspectives and expectations of a given position:\n\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"charts/template-dark.png\">\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"charts/template.png\">\n  <img alt=\"Template Chart\" src=\"charts/template.png\">\n</picture>\n\nThe framework has 4 different ladders:\n\n- role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise\n- role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support\n- role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that span multiple teams\n- role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team\n\nIf you are confused about the difference between a  and an , please refer to the  page for a detailed comparison.\n\n| Level | Senior |  |  |  |  |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: |\n| 1 | No |  | | | |\n| 2 | No |  | | | |\n| 3 | No |  | | | |\n| 4 | Yes |  |  |  | |\n| 5 | Yes |  |  |  |  |\n| 6 | Yes |  |  |  |  |\n| 7 | Yes |  |  |  |  |\n\n(click on position name for more details)\n\nThe chart shown above has the following 5 axes:\nTechnology: knowledge of the tech stack and tools\nSystem: level of ownership of the system(s)\nPeople: relationship with the team(s)\nProcess: level of engagement with the development process\nInfluence: scope of influence of the position\n\nThe influence axis can be seen as a different dimension since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.\n\nEach axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that evangelizes technology, specializes and adopts it as well.\n\nKeep reading to better understand each level.\n\n**Adopts**: actively learns and adopts the technology and tools defined by the team\n**Specializes**: is the go-to person for one or more technologies and takes initiative to learn new ones\n**Evangelizes**: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team\n**Masters**: has very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system\n**Creates**: designs and creates new technologies that are widely used either by internal or external teams\n\n**Enhances**: successfully pushes new features and bug fixes to improve and extend the system\n**Designs**: designs and implements medium to large size features while reducing the system's tech debt\n**Owns**: owns the production operation and monitoring of the system and is aware of its SLAs\n**Evolves**: evolves the architecture to support future requirements and defines its SLAs\n**Leads**: leads the technical excellence of the system and creates plans to mitigate outages\n\n**Learns**: quickly learns from others and consistently steps up when it is required\n**Supports**: proactively supports other team members and helps them to be successful\n**Mentors**: mentors others to accelerate their career-growth and encourages them to participate\n**Coordinates**: coordinates team members providing effective feedback and moderating discussions\n**Manages**: manages the team members' career, expectations, performance and level of happiness\n\n**Follows**: follows the team processes, delivering a consistent flow of features to production\n**Enforces**: enforces the team processes, making sure everybody understands the benefits and tradeoffs\n**Challenges**: challenges the team processes, looking for ways to improve them\n**Adjusts**: adjusts the team processes, listening to feedback and guiding the team through the changes\n**Defines**: defines the right processes for the team's maturity level, balancing agility and discipline\n\n**Subsystem**: makes an impact on one or more subsystems\n**Team**: makes an impact on the whole team, not just on specific parts of it\n**Multiple Teams**: makes an impact not only his/her team but also on other teams\n**Company**: makes an impact on the whole tech organization\n**Community**: makes an impact on the tech community\n\nWhat if some of the people don't meet all the points? That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.\n\nWhat if my organization's career ladder is different? Since the framework is open source, you have the opportunity to adapt it to your organization. Feel free to use the  to define your own levels.\n\nWhen is a person ready to move to the next level? Companies usually expect a person to be performing at the next level consistently for several months before formalizing a promotion.\n\nHow do I collect evidence to support the discussion with my direct reports? Different teams collect evidence in different ways. A recommended approach is to use a combination of:\n1:1 conversations\nFeedback from peers and other teams\nSelf-evaluation\n\nCould the framework provide more specific examples of behavior to support each level? Specific examples of behavior require knowledge about the way that the team works, the system architecture and its technology stack. It is recommended to allow each team to define their own examples.\n\nWhy does the framework stop at level 7? Levels 8 and above vary drastically from company to company. Organizations of different sizes tend to assign a diverse level of scope to positions so high in their structure.\n\nDo you have any additional resources about the topic? Camille Fournier does an excellent job at describing the expectations and challenges of many engineering positions. Also, she provides good advice about writing a career ladder in chapter : Dick Grote explains in simple terms how to define job responsibilities and how to evaluate performance (results and behaviors).\""

Typing `x/g30x $esp` is not fun, and does not  confer much information.  The year is 2024 and GDB still lacks a real hexdump command!  GDB's syntax is arcane and difficult to approach.  Windbg users are completely lost when they occasionally need to bump into GDB.\n\nPwndbg is a Python module which is loaded directly into GDB, and provides a suite of utilities and crutches to hack around all of the cruft that is GDB and smooth out the rough edges.\n\nMany other projects from the past (e.g., [gdbinit][gdbinit], [PEDA][PEDA]) and present (e.g. [GEF][GEF]) exist to fill some these gaps.  Each provides an excellent experience and great features -but they're difficult to extend (some are unmaintained, and all are a single [100KB][gdbinit2], [200KB][peda.py], or [363KB][gef.py] file (respectively)).\n\nPwndbg exists not only to replace all of its predecessors, but also to have a clean implementation that runs quickly and is resilient against all the weird corner cases that come up.

It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios.\n\nUsing Chaos Mesh, you can conveniently simulate various abnormalities that might occur in reality during the development, testing, and production environments and find potential problems in the system. To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides you with a visualization operation. You can easily design your Chaos scenarios on the Web UI and monitor the status of Chaos experiments.\n\nChaos Mesh is an incubating project. If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Chaos Mesh plays a role, read the CNCF.\n\nAt the current stage, Chaos Mesh has the following components:\n\nChaos Operator: the core component for chaos orchestration. Fully open sourced.\nChaos Dashboard: a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments.\n\nChaos Operator injects chaos into the applications and Kubernetes infrastructure in a manageable way, which provides easy, custom definitions for chaos experiments and automatic orchestration. There are two components at play:\n\nChaos Controller Manager: is primarily responsible for the scheduling and management of Chaos experiments. This component contains several CRD Controllers, such as Workflow Controller, Scheduler Controller, and Controllers of various fault types.\n\nChaos Daemon: runs as DaemonSet and has Privileged permission by default (which can be disabled). This component mainly interferes with specific network devices, file systems, kernels by hacking into the target Pod Namespace.\n\nChaos Operator uses to define chaos objects.\n\nThe current implementation supports a few types of CRD objects for fault injection, namely PodChaos, NetworkChaos, IOChaos, TimeChaos, StressChaos, and so on. You can get the full list of CRD objects and their specifications in the .\n\nSee and .\n\nSee and .\n\nSee .\n\nBlogs on Chaos Mesh design & implementation, features, chaos engineering, community updates, etc. See .

FLARE-VM was designed to solve the problem of reverse engineering tool curation and relies on two main technologies: Chocolatey and Boxstarter. Chocolatey is a Windows-based Nuget package management system, where a \"package\" is essentially a ZIP file containing PowerShell installation scripts that download and configure a specific tool. Boxstarter leverages Chocolatey packages to automate the installation of software and create repeatable, scripted Windows environments.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"Images/flarevm-logo.png\" alt=\"FLARE-VM Logo\" width=\"600\">\n</p>\n\n**FLARE-VM should ONLY be installed on a virtual machine**.\nThe VM should satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Windows >= 10\n- PowerShell >= 5\n- Disk capacity of at least 60 GB and memory of at least 2GB\n- Usernames without spaces or other special characters\n- Internet connection\n- Tamper Protection and any Anti-Malware solution (e.g., Windows Defender), preferably via Group Policy\n- Windows Defender disabled, preferably via Group Policy\n- Windows Updates Disabled\n\nThis section documents the steps to install FLARE-VM.

This file contains the default configuration, including the list of packages to install and the environment variable paths. You may use your own configuration by specifying the CLI-argument `-customConfig` and providing either a local file path or URL to your `config.xml` file. For example:\n\nFor example:\nTo show known file extensions:\n\nFor more examples, check the default configuration file: [default-config.xml](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm/blob/main/config.xml).\n\nThe installer will use `CustomStartLayout.xml` from the FLARE-VM repository.

You may use your own configuration by specifying the CLI-argument `-customLayout` and providing a local file path or URL to your `CustomStartLayout.xml` file. For example:\n\nItems in the .xml that are not installed will not display in the taskbar (no broken links will be pinned)\nOnly applications (.exe files) or shortcuts to applications can be pinned.\nIf you would like to pin something that isn't an application, consider creating a shortcut that points to `cmd.exe` or `powershell` with arguments supplied that will perform that actions you would like.\nIf you would like to make something run with admin rights, consider making a shortcut using `VM-Install-Shortcut` with the flag `-runAsAdmin` and pinning the shortcut.\n\nYou can include any post installation step you like in the configuration inside the tags `apps`, `services`, `path-items`, `registry-items`, and `custom-items`.\n\nFor example:\nTo show known file extensions:\n\nFor more examples, check the default configuration file: [default-config.xml](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm/blob/main/config.xml).\n\nWant to get started contributing?

This includes having their internet, wireless, bluetooth, USB, external file storage and audio capabilities removed. This is called \"air gapping\". Even in such a situation, this program can transmit radio.\n\nPublicly available documents already discuss exfiltration from secured systems using various electromagnetic radiations. This is documented in the TEMPEST guidelines published by the US National Security Agency and the US Department of Defense. This project simply adds to that discussion.\n\nTry it in your browser, click here: <http://fulldecent.github.io/system-bus-radio/>\n\nEnter the implementations folder, select any of them and compile using `make`.\n\nRun this using a 2015 model MacBook Air. Then use a Sony STR-K670P radio receiver with the included antenna and tune it to 1580 kHz on AM.\n\nRun it and reference the a tune file or make your own!\n\nYou should hear the \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" tune playing repeatedly. Other equipment and tuning may work as well. On the equipment above, the author has achieved clear transmission over two meters of open air or one meter through drywall. Different results will be achievable with different equipment.\n\nAre you using an antenna? At the beginning, the author placed the antenna directly on top of the number 4 key and that worked best (on any AM frequency). It was a round antenna. Then once they knew it worked they moved the antenna back. Moving it back reduced the number of frequencies that it worked on, and eventually only that one (1580 kHz) worked. Different hardware will certainly have different frequency response. Here are some results that have been sent in by readers. Please mail <github.com@phor.net> with your results (including makes and models of all equipment involved) or and create a pull request.\n\nWANTED: Please post your test results using Raspberry Pi and other embedded systems. This may be particularly good targets because of less shielding/hardening of their hardware.\n\nSee our basic RTL SDR guide to receive system bus signals using another computer with RTL SDR hardware.\n\nThis program runs instructions on the computer that cause electromagnetic radiation. The emissions are of a broad frequency range. To be accepted by the radio, those frequencies must:\n\nBe emitted by the computer processor and other subsystems\nEscape the computer shielding\nPass through the air or other obstructions\nBe accepted by the antenna\nBe selected by the receiver\n\nBy trial and error, the above frequency was found to be ideal for that equipment.\n\nThe actual emissions are caused by the `_mm_stream_si128` instruction that writes through to a memory address. Inspiration for using this instruction was provided in:\n\nGuri, M., Kachlon, A., Hasson, O., Kedma, G., Mirsky, Y. and Elovici, Y., GSMem: data exfiltration from air-gapped computers over GSM frequencies. In 24th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 15) (pp. 849-864).\n<https://www.usenix.org/node/190937>\n\nPlease note that replacing `_mm_stream_si128` with a simple `x++;` will work too. The author's experience has been that `_mm_stream_si128` produces a stronger signal. There may be other ideas that work even better, and it would be nice to improve this method to be more portable (not require SSE extensions).\n\nThe program uses square wave modulation, which is depicted below:\n\nNotes on high precision time APIs:\n\nGet current time:\n  mach_absolute_time() gives time in int64_t of nanoseconds\n    Converting to nanoseconds <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1398/_index.html>\n    Declared <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/osfmk/mach/mach_time.h>\n    Definition <https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-320/i386/mach/mach_absolute_time.c>\n  clock_get_time() gives a mach_timespec_t time\n    Called from mach_absolute_time()\n  mach_timespec_t\n    Type documentation <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/services/services.html>\n    Declaration <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/osfmk/mach/clock_types.h>\n  <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21352348/300224>\n  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5167269/clock-gettime-alternative-in-mac-os-x>\nSleep:\n  mach_wait_until()\n    Notes <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2169/_index.html>\n  nanosleep()\n    Apple doc <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/nanosleep.2.html>\n    Definition <https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-320.1.3/gen/nanosleep.c?txt>\n  clock_sleep_trap()\n    Used from nanosleep()\n    Declared <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/osfmk/mach/mach_traps.h>\n    Definition <http://unix.superglobalmegacorp.com/xnu/newsrc/osfmk/kern/clock.c.html>\n    Uses clock_sleep_internal()\n    Uses ADD_MACH_TIMESPEC\n  clock type constants <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/osfmk/mach/clock_types.h?txt>\n    TIME_ABSOLUTE\n    TIME_RELATIVE\n    Defines ADD_MACH_TIMESPEC(t1, t2) // t1  += t2\n    Defines CMP_MACH_TIMESPEC(t1, t2) // t1 <=> t2, also (t1 t2) in nsec with max of +1 sec\n  msleep() <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/services/services.html>\n    time/timer.c /  <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/time/timer.c\n  kern/clock.h <https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/osfmk/kern/clock.h>\n\n<https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/16/03/01/1727226/microcasting-color-tv-by-abusing-a-wi-fi-chip>\n<https://news.softpedia.com/news/emitting-radio-waves-from-a-computer-with-no-radio-transmitting-hardware-501260.shtml>\n<https://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2018/01/system-bus-radio.html>\""

It is based on Alibaba's nearly ten years of failure testing and drill practice, and combines the best ideas and practices of the Group's businesses.\n\nChaosBlade is not only easy to use, but also supports rich experimental scenarios. The scenarios include:\n- Basic resources: such as CPU, memory, network, disk, process and other experimental scenarios;\n- Java applications: such as databases, caches, messages, JVM itself, microservices, etc. You can also specify any class method to inject various complex experimental scenarios;\n- C++ applications: such as specifying arbitrary methods or experimental lines of code injection delay, tampering with variables and return values;\n- Container: such as killing the container, the CPU in the container, memory, network, disk, process and other experimental scenarios;\n- Cloud-native platforms: For example, CPU, memory, network, disk, and process experimental scenarios on Kubernetes platform nodes, Pod network and Pod itself experimental scenarios such as killing Pods, and container experimental scenarios such as the aforementioned Docker container experimental scenario;\n\nEncapsulating scenes by domain into individual projects can not only standardize the scenes in the domain, but also facilitate the horizontal and vertical expansion of the scenes. By following the chaos experimental model, the chaosblade cli can be called uniformly. The items currently included are:\n- Chaos experiment management tool, including commands for creating experiments, destroying experiments, querying experiments, preparing experimental environments, and canceling experimental environments. It is the execution of chaotic experiments. Tools, execution methods include CLI and HTTP. Provides complete commands, experimental scenarios, and scenario parameter descriptions, and the operation is simple and clear.\n- Chaos experimental model Golang language definition, scenes implemented using Golang language are easy to implement based on this specification.\n- Implementation of basic resource experimental scenarios.\n- Docker container experimental scenario implementation, standardized by calling the Docker API.\n- Container experimental scenario implementation, standardized by calling the CRI.\n- Kubernetes platform experimental scenario is implemented, chaos experiments are defined by Kubernetes standard CRD method, it is very convenient to use Kubernetes resource operation method To create, update, and delete experimental scenarios, including using kubectl, client-go, etc., and also using the chaosblade cli tool described above.\n- Java application experimental scenario implementation, using Java Agent technology to mount dynamically, without any access, zero-cost use It also supports uninstallation and completely recycles various resources created by the Agent.\n- C++ application experimental scenario implementation, using GDB technology to implement method and code line level experimental scenario injection.\n\n\nYou can download the latest chaosblade toolkit from  and extract it and use it. If you want to inject Kubernetes related fault scenarios, you need to install . For detailed Chinese usage documents, please see .\n\nchaosblade supports CLI and HTTP invocation methods. The supported commands are as follows:\n- prepare: alias is p, preparation before the chaos engineering experiment, such as drilling Java applications, you need to attach the java agent. For example, to drill an application whose application name is business, execute `blade p jvm --process business` on the target host. If the attach is successful, return the uid for status query or agent revoke.\n- revoke: alias is r, undo chaos engineering experiment preparation before, such as detaching java agent. The command is `blade revoke UID`\n- create: alias is c, create a chaos engineering experiment. The command is `blade create [TARGET] [ACTION] [FLAGS]`. For example, if you implement a Dubbo consumer call xxx.xxx.Service interface delay 3s, the command executed is `blade create dubbo delay --consumer --time 3000 --Service xxx.xxx.Service`, if the injection is successful, return the experimental uid for status query and destroy the experiment.\n- destroy: alias is d, destroy a chaos engineering experiment, such as destroying the Dubbo delay experiment mentioned above, the command is `blade destroy UID`\n- status: alias s, query preparation stage or experiment status, the command is `blade status UID` or `blade status --type create`\n- server: start the web server, expose the HTTP service, and call chaosblade through HTTP requests. For example, execute on the target machine xxxx: `blade server start -p 9526` to perform a CPU full load experiment:` curl \"http://xxxx:9526/chaosblade?cmd=create%20cpu%20fullload\" `\n\nUse the `blade help [COMMAND]` or `blade [COMMAND] -h` command to view help\n\n\nDownload the chaosblade demo image and experience the use of the blade toolkit\n\n\n\nDownload image command：\n\nRun the demo container：\n\nAfter entering the container, you can read the README.txt file to implement the chaos experiment, Enjoy it.\n\n\n The project is a chaos experiment injection tool for cloud-native platforms. It follows the chaos experiment model to standardize the experimental scenario and defines the experiment as Kubernetes CRD Resources, mapping experimental models to Kubernetes resource attributes, and very friendly combination of chaotic experimental models with Kubernetes declarative design. While relying on chaotic experimental models to conveniently develop scenarios, it can also well integrate Kubernetes design concepts, through kubectl or Write code to directly call the Kubernetes API to create, update, and delete chaotic experiments, and the resource status can clearly indicate the execution status of the experiment, and standardize Kubernetes fault injection. In addition to using the above methods to perform experiments, you can also use the chaosblade cli method to execute kubernetes experimental scenarios and query the experimental status very conveniently. For details, please read the chinese document: \n\n\nThis project is written in golang, so you need to install the latest golang version first. The minimum supported version is 1.After the Clone project, enter the project directory and execute the following command to compile:\n\nIf on a mac system, compile the current system version, execute:\n\nIf you want to compile linux system version on mac system, execute:\n\nYou can also compile selectively, for example, you only need to compile cli and os scenes, then execute:\n\n\nArch Linux install \n\n\n\nFor bug report, questions and discussions please submit .\n\nYou can also contact us via:\nDingding group (recommended for chinese): 23177705\nSlack group: \nGitter room: \nEmail: chaosblade.io.01@gmail.com\nTwitter: \n\n\nWe welcome every contribution, even if it is just punctuation. See details of . For the promotion ladder of specific community participation students, see： ()\n\n\nThe original intention of our open source project is to lower the threshold for chaos engineering to be implemented in enterprises, so we highly value the use of the project in enterprises. Welcome everyone here . After registration, you will be invited to join the corporate mail group to discuss the problems encountered by Chaos Engineering in the landing of the company and share the landing experience.\n\n\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute. ].\n<a href=\"https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/chaosblade/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false\" /></a>\n\n\nChaosblade is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.See  for the full license text.\""

Think of it as an alternative or supplement to college or bootcamp education. It aims to serve as a guidebook for beginners planning to make a career transition into software engineering, computer science students looking to expand their practical knowledge, and experienced engineers curious to seek references for other subject matters.\n\nEach topic in this curriculum includes only a single reference for readers to gain familiarity and understanding in a short period of time. Tutorials with clear content structure and hands-on examples are selected over other references. Some would say it is taking a breadth-first search approach to computer science learning.\n\nThis curriculum is divided into four major sections: fundamentals, advanced, tracks, and subjects. Fundamentals cover the core part of computer science and are often required as the lower-division courses in universities. Advanced goes more in depth on various computer science subjects and are usually topics discussed in upper-vision university electives. Tracks outline the most common software engineering roles and provide relevant topics for introductory understanding. Subjects offer content for specialization fields researched in corporate research labs and startup initiatives.\n\nIf you are just starting, it is recommended to go through the fundamentals in order, then pick a subset of advanced topics to read at will. For the curious ones, use tracks and subjects as references when choosing career options that most interest you.\n\n\n\nFundamentals\n    CS 101\n    Data Structures & Algorithms\n    Operating

This is the link to the GitHub pages site repository: <https://github.com/0xZ0F/0xZ0F.github.io>\n\nThis course aims to take an individual from beginner to intermediate (advanced is really only achieved through experience) in reverse engineering. While this course focuses on Windows 64-bit, the technical knowledge applies to 32-bit Windows and the theory to any OS.\n\nThe choice has been made for 64-bit Windows since it's modern and the most common OS and architecture. In addition, we only have to deal with one calling convention.\n\nFor a more interactive experience with the initial portion of the course (chapters 1 through 6), try out the course on <https://www.debugxp.com/posts/RECourse>.\n\nThere are some PDFs created and provided in ZIP files. They may not be up to date, so it's recommended to follow the normal markdown version of the course. The PDFs were provided due to a high number of requests for them.\n\nThe password for the ZIP files is \"reverse\" (without the quotes).\n\nPlease take a moment to read <https://www.debugxp.com/posts/RECourse#contact>.\n\nJoin the Discord server: *Use the Discord server to ask for help and stay updated with the course!\n\nThis course is going to teach anyone how to reverse engineer x64 Windows. We will start by covering some basics of binaries, then reverse some small samples, reverse a DLL and implement it into our own program, reverse some malware, then look at some realistic situations.\n\nThe goal is not to teach you how to smash your head against assembly. Rather, I want to teach how to use tools to enhance your skills and capabilities. For example, we will cover how to log function calls for easier analysis using a debugger or writing our own code for more control.\n\nReversing is made so much harder because of the lack of resources to learn it. Most content is outdated, overpriced, hard to follow, or low quality. Reversing is already considered by many to be a difficult field to get into. Something being difficult isn't an issue, but when it gets needlessly difficult there is an issue. After reading multiple books, countless blog posts, extensive documentation, following multiple YouTube \"tutorials\", and much more, I feel like it's time for someone to make a dedicated course. I don't think it should be that hard to learn one topic. I certainly don't want people to have to go through the mess I went through, so I decided to make this course. I love this field and I wanted to give back to the community. Here's my gift to you and the rest of the community. Hopefully, there are a few people out there that this course can help.\n\nFollow me on Twitter! Discord Server: <https://www.debugxp.com/posts/RECourse#contact>\n\nPlease give me any and all honest feedback you have. Don't worry about hurting my feelings, I want to make this course as good as I can. I can't do that alone, that's why your feedback is so important.\n\nThe best way to stay up-to-date is to support me on Patreon which will give you access to the Patreon-only feed.

If you are learning Prompt Engineering, I hope this tutorial can help.\n\n: An AI tutorial for everyone. Still working hard on it. Stay tuned.\n: From basics to advanced, from a user's perspective, this teaches you how to use ChatGPT and how to use it even better.\n: Through various examples, this teaches you how to use Midjourney. Even as a beginner, after reading this, you'll be able to quickly get started.\n\nWhat this is not:\n\nThis is not a prompt collection. If you're expecting to find prompts to use directly, I'd recommend Googling instead. This focuses more on teaching methods and explaining why they work.\nThis is not meant as an authoritative guide. In this field, I'm also a student.\n\n\n\nThanks for opening this tutorial. When reading it, I suggest:\n\n**Lower expectations: *I'm no expert. I'm learning too, just a few steps ahead of you. There may be gaps or errors here. Also, for beginners, analogies or terms may be dumbed down a bit to aid understanding. Please be tolerant.\n**Feedback is welcomed: *If parts don't make sense or seem wrong, please raise an issue or use the form. Let's improve together and contribute to furthering PE.\n**Learn by doing: *The best way is hands-on practice. There are examples to try as you read. Even better, share prompts you write via issues/forms. I'll add good ones to the doc.\n\nI believe the best way to learn is by doing. So try the examples in ChatGPT or Midjourney. It'll help cement the concepts.\n\nYou'll see these emojis:\n\n🚧 : Contents need more work but don't affect reading. I'll improve later.\n🆘 : I need help here, e.g. prompt examples for a scenario. Ideas welcome via issues/Discord.\n🔴 : To prep you for advanced sections, basics may mention advanced concepts. No need to dive deep yet.\n\n\n\nIf you can, please star this on  or share the tutorial.

Through the ChaosExperiment, Litmus supports BYOC (bring-your-own-chaos) that helps integrate (optional) any third-party tooling to perform the fault injection. \n\nChaosEngine: A resource to link a Kubernetes application workload/service, node or an infra component to a fault described by the ChaosExperiment. It also provides options to tune the run properties and specify the steady state validation constraints using 'probes'. ChaosEngine is watched by the Chaos-Operator, which reconciles it (triggers experiment execution) via runners. \n\nThe ChaosExperiment & ChaosEngine CRs are embedded within a Workflow object that can \""

During the process of reverse engineering, they can learn architectures of those excellent Apps so that they can improve their ability of architecture design\n- Reverse engineers in other systems who’re also interested in iOS\n\nThe book consists of 4 parts, i.e. concepts, tools, theories and practices. The book follows an \"abstraction, concrete, abstraction, concrete\" structure, starting from basic concepts like iOS filesystem hierarchy and iOS file types that Apple didn't expose to App developers but iOS (jailbreak) researchers should know, then goes through the most commonly used tools like class-dump, Theos, Cycript, Reveal, IDA and LLDB to introduce what to do in iOS reverse engineering. After that, iOS reverse engineering theories based on Objective-C and ARM assembly are explained in a methodological way, pointing out the core of this book. Last but not least, 4 originally elaborated practices are there to cover all previous contents of the book and give you the most intuitive perception of iOS reverse engineering.

Unlike other similar bytecode editors, Javassist provides two levels of API: source level and bytecode level. If the users use the sourcelevel API, they can edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java bytecode. The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the Java language. You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. On the other hand, the bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file as other editors.\n\nThis software is distributed under the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1, the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 or later, or the Apache License Version 2.\n\nThis readme file.\n\nRelease notes.\n\nLicense file.\n\nTutorial.\n\n./javassist.jar\nThe Javassist jar file (class files).\n\n./src/main\nThe source files\n\nHow to run examples.\n\nThe top page of the Javassist API document.\n\nTo print the version number, type this command:\n\nThe development of this software is sponsored in part by the PRESTO and CREST programs of [Japan Science and Technology Agency](http://www.jst.go.jp/).\n\nI'd like to thank Michiaki Tatsubori, Johan Cloetens, Philip Tomlinson, Alex Villazon, Pascal Rapicault, Dan HE, Eric Tanter, Michael Haupt, Toshiyuki Sasaki, Renaud Pawlak, Luc Bourlier, Eric Bui, Lewis Stiller, Susumu Yamazaki, Rodrigo Teruo Tomita, Marc Segura-Devillechaise, Jan Baudisch, Julien Blass, Yoshiki Sato, Fabian Crabus, Bo Norregaard Jorgensen, Bob Lee, Bill Burke, Remy Sanlaville, Muga Nishizawa, Alexey Loubyansky, Saori Oki, Andreas Salathe, Dante Torres estrada, S.

Here is\na non exhaustive list of features:\n\nOpening / modifying / generating PE / ELF 32 / 64 LE / BE\nAssembling / Disassembling X86 / ARM / MIPS / SH4 / MSP430\nRepresenting assembly semantic using intermediate language\nEmulating using JIT (dynamic code analysis, unpacking, ...)\nExpression simplification for automatic de-obfuscation\n...\n\nSee the official  for more examples and demos.\n\nTable of Contents\n=================\n\nBasic examples\n==============\n\nAssembling / Disassembling\n-------------------------Import Miasm x86 architecture:\n\nGet a location db:\n\n\nAssemble a line:\n\nModify an operand:\n\nDisassemble the result:\n\nUsing `Machine` abstraction:\n\n\n\nFor MIPS:\n\nIntermediate representation\n--------------------------Create an instruction:\n\n\n\nCreate an intermediate representation object:\n\nCreate an empty ircfg:\n\nAdd instruction to the pool:\n\n\nPrint current pool:\n\nWorking with IR, for instance by getting side effects:\n\n\nMore information on Miasm IR is in the .\n\nEmulation\n--------Giving a shellcode:\n\nImport the shellcode thanks to the `Container` abstraction:\n\n\n\nDisassembling the shellcode at address `0`:\n\n\n\nInitializing the JIT engine with a stack:\n\n\n\nAdd the shellcode in an arbitrary memory location:\n\n\nCreate a sentinelle to catch the return of the shellcode:\n\n\n\nActive logs:\n\n\n\nRun at arbitrary address:\n\n\n\nInteracting with the jitter:\n\n\n\nSymbolic execution\n-----------------Initializing the IR pool:\n\n\n\nInitializing the engine with default symbolic values:\n\n\n\nLaunching the execution:\n\n\n\nSame, with step logs (only changes are displayed):\n\n\n\n\nRetry execution with a concrete ECX. Here, the symbolic / concolic execution reach the shellcode's end:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n=================\n\nMiasm embeds its own disassembler, intermediate language and\ninstruction semantic. It is written in Python.\n\nTo emulate code, it uses LLVM, GCC, Clang or Python to JIT the\nintermediate representation. It can emulate shellcodes and all or parts of\nbinaries. Python callbacks can be executed to interact with the execution, for\ninstance to emulate library functions effects.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSome documentation ressources are available in the  folder.\n\nAn auto-generated documentation is available:\nObtaining Miasm\n===============\n\nClone the repository: \nGet one of the Docker images at \n\nSoftware requirements\n--------------------Miasm uses:\n\npython-pyparsing\npython-dev\noptionally python-pycparser (version >= 2.17)\n\nTo enable code JIT, one of the following module is mandatory:\nGCC\nClang\nLLVM with Numba llvmlite, see below\n\n'optional' Miasm can also use:\nZ3, the \n\nConfiguration\n------------To use the jitter, GCC or LLVM is recommended\nGCC (any version)\nClang (any version)\nLLVM\n  Debian (testing/unstable): Not tested\n  Debian stable/Ubuntu/Kali/whatever: `pip install llvmlite` or install from \n  Windows: Not tested\nBuild and install Miasm:\n\n\nIf something goes wrong during one of the jitter modules compilation, Miasm will\nskip the error and disable the corresponding module (see the compilation\noutput).\n\nWindows & IDA\n------------Most of Miasm's IDA plugins use a subset of Miasm functionality.\nA quick way to have them working is to add:\n`pyparsing.py` to `C:\\...\\IDA\\python\\` or `pip install pyparsing`\n`miasm/miasm` directory to `C:\\...\\IDA\\python\\`\n\nAll features excepting JITter related ones will be available. For a more complete installation, please refer to above paragraphs.\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nMiasm comes with a set of regression tests. To run all of them:\n\n\n\nSome options can be specified:\n\nMono threading: `-m`\nCode coverage instrumentation: `-c`\nOnly fast tests: `-t long` (excludes the long tests)\n\nThey already use Miasm\n======================\n\nTools\n----: A function divination tool\n: Use miasm as a radare2 plugin\n: Targeted patcher for CGC binaries\n: Reversing tool for Ethereum EVM (with corresponding Miasm2 architecture)\n\nBlog posts / papers / conferences\n--------------------------------: Quick computation of DGA (French article)\n: Detect undirected call potential arguments\n(French)\n(French video)\n: DepGraph (French)\n\nBooks\n----: Introduction to Miasm (Chapter 5 \"Obfuscation\")\n: Japan security bo\""

With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations. Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs. Standard methods facilitate such sequencing. In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.\n\nObjective: Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has substantial benefit in design of improved clinical tools and precise diagnostics. As examples of such applications, (i) Any medical or public health analysis relying on high throughput sequencing data to track SARS-COV2 and its variants would benefit from knowledge of vaccine sequences in order to distinguish RNA sequencing reads coming from the vaccine from those of viral origin, and (ii) Diagnostic labs designing nucleic acid surveillance tests (like PCR or LAMP assays) can benefit from vaccine sequence information to avoid confusion between vaccinated and infected test subjects when analyzing assay results.\n\nDescription: For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use. To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.\n\nAlthough our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA. Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations. We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable. But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation.\n\nFor further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing. As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).\n\nFrom these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly. This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out. Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets. The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference.\n\nRNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243). Numerous recent advances have resulted in approaches to minimize dsRNA (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30933724/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31900329/); nonetheless measurement remains a continued necessity. In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand. In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol. Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%). Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents actual dsRNA content in the original material.\n\nDespite the transience of RNA from any individual inoculation, these mRNA vaccines and their derivatives will likely continue to be manufactured and administered as key tools for taming the ongoing COVID pandemic. In such context, this work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.\n\nProtoAcknowledgements: We thank our colleagues here for their help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Nelson Hall, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Marc Salit), and additionally acknowledge numerous colleagues who have discussed and educated us (directly and indirectly) in areas of RNA synthesis enzymology, vaccine design, and software engineering.\n\nFigure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine. Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled cDNA-derived contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the vaccine RNA and would lack any indication of base modifications. Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/]. The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA. \n\nFigure 2: Spike-encoding contig assembled from Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. This is a partial sequence of the vaccine RNA. Although the full coding region is included, the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the vaccine RNA.\""

Its current version supports decompiling Linux x86_64 binaries, ranging from GCC's O0 to O3 optimization levels, into human-readable C source code. Our team is committed to expanding this tool's capabilities, with ongoing efforts to incorporate a broader range of architectures and configurations.\n\nTo demonstrate the usage of the LLM4Decompile model, including examples for the LLM4Decompile-End and LLM4Decompile-Ref models.\n\nThe LLM4Decompile-Ref model, fine-tuned based on the HumanEval-Decompile dataset, achieved a re-executability rate of **0.6494** on the Decompile benchmark. The series (LLM4Decompile-Ref) V2 (1.3B-22B), building upon Ghidra, are trained on 2 billion tokens to refine the decompiled pseudo-code from Ghidra. The 22B-V2 version outperforms the 6.7B-V1.5 by an additional 40.1%. Please check the paper for details.\n\nThe LLM4Decompile-End series (directly decompile binary using LLM) V1.5 are trained with a larger dataset (15B tokens) and a maximum token length of 4,096, with remarkable performance (over **100% improvement**) compared to the previous model. The model which is trained without prior knowledge of the optimization levels (O0~O3), the average re-executability is around 0.219, performs the best in our models.\n\n**Re-executability** evaluates whether the decompiled code can execute properly and pass all the predefined test cases.\n\n**HumanEval-Decompile** is a collection of 164 C functions that exclusively rely on standard C libraries. **ExeBench** is a collection of 2,621 functions drawn from real projects, each utilizing user-defined functions, structures, and macros.\n\nDuring compilation, the Preprocessor processes the source code (SRC) to eliminate comments and expand macros or includes. The cleaned code is then forwarded to the Compiler, which converts it into assembly code (ASM). This ASM is transformed into binary code (0s and 1s) by the Assembler. The Linker finalizes the process by linking function calls to create an executable file. Decompilation, on the other hand, involves converting binary code back into a source file. LLMs, being trained on text, lack the ability to process binary data directly. Therefore, binaries must be disassembled by a disassembler into assembly language (ASM) first. It should be noted that binary and disassembled ASM are equivalent, they can be interconverted, and thus we refer to them interchangeably. Finally, the loss is computed between the decompiled code and source code to guide the training. To assess the quality of the decompiled code (SRC'), it is tested for its functionality through test assertions (re-executability).\n\n**Setup:** Please use the script below to install the necessary environment.\n\nHere is an example of how to use our model (Revised for V1). For previous models, please check the corresponding model page at HF.\n\nNote: Replace the \"func0\" with the function name you want to decompile.\n\n**Preprocessing:** Compile the C code into binary, and disassemble the binary into assembly instructions. Assembly instructions should be in the format:\n\n<FUNCTION_NAME>:\\nOPERATIONS\\nOPERATIONS\\n\n\nTypical assembly instructions may look like this:\n\n**Decompilation:** Use LLM4Decompile to translate the assembly instructions into C:\n\nData are stored in `llm4decompile/decompile-eval/decompile-eval-executable-gcc-obj.json`, using JSON list format. There are 164*4 (O0, O1, O2, O3) samples, each with five keys:\n\n``task_id``: indicates the ID of the problem.\n``type``: the optimization stage, is one of [O0, O1, O2, O3].\n``c_func``: C solution for HumanEval problem. \n``c_test``: C test assertions.\n``input_asm_prompt``: assembly instructions with prompts, can be derived as in our paper.\n\nPlease check the paper.\n\nLarger training dataset with the cleaning process.

The agent outputs runnable Python code that hits the platform's internal endpoints to perform the desired action.\n\nLet's assume we want to download utility bills:\n\nThe agent identifies the request that downloads the utility bills.\nFor example, the request URL might look like this:\n\nIt identifies parts of the request that depend on other requests.\nThe above URL contains dynamic parts (accountId and userId) that need to be obtained from other requests.\n\nIt finds the requests that provide these parts and makes the download request dependent on them. It also attaches these requests to the original request to build out a dependency graph.\n\nThis process repeats until the request being checked depends on no other request and only requires the authentication cookies.\nThe agent traverses up the graph, starting from nodes (requests) with no outgoing edges until it reaches the master node while converting each node to a runnable function.\n\nGenerate a dependency graph of requests to make the final request that performs the desired action.\nAllow input variables (for example, choosing the YEAR to download a document from). This is currently only supported for graph generation. Input variables for code generation coming soon!\nGenerate code to hit all requests in the graph to perform the desired action.\n\nSet up your OpenAI and add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. (We recommend using an account with access to models that are at least as capable as OpenAI o1-mini. Models on par with OpenAI o1-preview are ideal.)\nInstall Python requirements via poetry:\nOpen a poetry shell:\nRegister the Poetry virtual environment with Jupyter:\nRun the following command to spawn a browser:\nLog into your platform and perform the desired action (such as downloading a utility bill).\nRun Integuru:\nYou can also run it via Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb`\n\n**Recommended to use gpt-4o as the model for graph generation as it supports function calling. Integuru will automatically switch to o1-preview for code generation if available in the user's OpenAI account.**⚠️ **Note: o1-preview does not support function calls.**\nAfter setting up the project, you can use Integuru to analyze and reverse-engineer API requests for external platforms. Simply provide the appropriate .har file and a prompt describing the action that you want to trigger.\n\nTo run unit tests using `pytest`, use the following command:\n\nThis repository includes a CI workflow using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and is triggered on each push and pull request to the `main` branch. The workflow performs the following steps:\n\nChecks out the code.\nSets up Python 3.\nInstalls dependencies using `poetry`.\nRuns tests using `pytest`.\n\nWhen the destination site uses two-factor authentication (2FA), the workflow remains the same. Ensure that you complete the 2FA process and obtain the cookies/auth tokens/session tokens after 2FA. These tokens will be used in the workflow.\n\nContributions to improve Integuru are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests on the project's repository.\n\nInteguru is built by Integuru.ai. Besides our work on the agent, we take custom requests for new integrations or additional features for existing supported platforms. We also offer hosting and authentication services. If you have requests or want to work with us, reach out at richard@taiki.online.\n\nWe open-source unofficial APIs that we've built already. You can find them .\n\nCollected data is stored locally in the `network_requests.har` and `cookies.json` files.\n\nThe tool uses a cloud-based LLM (OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1-preview models).\n\nThe LLM is not trained or improved by the usage of this tool.\""

It can leverage them to explain what a function does and to automatically rename its variables. Here is a simple example of what results it can provide in mere seconds:\n\nSimply drop this script (`gepetto.py`, as well as the `gepetto/` folder) into your IDA plugins folder (`$IDAUSR/plugins`). By default, on Windows, this should be `%AppData%\\Hex-Rays\\IDA Pro\\plugins` (you may need to create it).\n\nYou will need to add the required packages to IDA's Python installation for the script to work. Find which interpreter IDA is using by checking the following registry key: `Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Hex-Rays\\IDA` (default on Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\Python\\Python39`). Finally, with the corresponding interpreter, simply run the following:\n\n⚠️ You will also need to edit the configuration file (found as `gepetto/config.ini`) and add your own API keys. For OpenAI, it can be found on . Please note that API queries are usually not free (although not very expensive) and you will need to set up a payment method with the corresponding provider.\n\ngpt-3.5-turbo-0125\ngpt-4-turbo\ngpt-4o (recommended for beginners)\nAny local model exposed through Ollama (will not appear if Ollama is not running)\nllama-3.1-70b-versatile\nllama-3.2-90b-text-preview\nmixtral-8x7b-32768\nmistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (does not support renaming variables)\nmeta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct\nmeta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct\n\nAdding support for additional models shouldn't be too difficult, provided whatever provider you're considering exposes an API similar to OpenAI's. Look into the `gepetto/models` folder for inspiration, or open an issue if you can't figure it out.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed properly, you should be able to invoke it from the context menu of IDA's pseudocode window, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nSwitch between models supported by Gepetto from the Edit > Gepetto menu:\n\nGepetto also provides a CLI interface you can use to ask questions to the LLM directly from IDA. Make sure to select `Gepetto` in the input bar:\n\nThe following hotkeys are available:\n\nAsk the model to explain the function: `Ctrl` `Alt` `G`\nRequest better names for the function's variables: `Ctrl` `Alt` `R`\n\nInitial testing shows that asking for better names works better if you ask for an explanation of the function first – I assume because the model then uses its own comment to make more accurate suggestions. There is an element of randomness to the AI's replies. If for some reason the initial response you get doesn't suit you, you can always run the command again.\n\nThe plugin requires access to the HexRays decompiler to function. All supported LLMs are general-purpose and may very well get things wrong! Always be critical of results returned!\n\nYou can change Gepetto's language by editing the locale in the configuration. For instance, to use the plugin in French, you would simply add:\n\nThe chosen locale must match the folder names in `gepetto/locales`. If the desired language isn't available, you can contribute to the project by adding it yourself! Create a new folder for the desired locale (ex: `gepetto/locales/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/`), and open a new pull request with the updated `.po` file, which you can create by copying and editing `gepetto/locales/gepetto.pot` (replace all the lines starting with `msgstr` with the localized version).\n\nFor making these incredible models, obviously, the makers of IDA for their lightning fast support, for initially funding this project, and the current backer making this work possible. For contributing ideas of additional models and providers to support via his donation. Everyone who contributed translations: @seifreed, @kot-igor, @ruzgarkanar, @orangetw\""

Once the mtk script is running, boot into brom mode by powering off device, press and hold either vol up power or vol down power and connect the phone. Once detected by the tool, release the buttons. These chipsets use a new protocol called V6 and the bootrom is patched, thus you need a valid da via --loader option.

If you're here it means that you share my interest for application security and exploitation on iOS. Or maybe you just clicked the wrong link 😂\n\nAll the vulnerabilities that I'll show you here are real, they've been found in production applications by security researchers, including myself, as part of bug bounty programs or just regular research. One of the reasons why you don't often see writeups with these types of vulnerabilities is because most of the companies prohibit the publication of such content. We've helped these companies by reporting them these issues and we've been rewarded with bounties for that, but no one other than the researcher(s) and the company's engineering team will learn from those experiences. This is part of the reason I decided to create this course, by creating a fake iOS application that contains all the vulnerabilities I've encountered in my own research or in the very few publications from other researchers. Even though there are already some projects[^1] aimed to teach you common issues on iOS applications, I felt like we needed one that showed the kind of vulnerabilities we've seen on applications downloaded from the App Store.\n\nThis course is divided in 5 modules that will take you from zero to reversing production applications on the Apple App Store. Every module is intended to explain a single part of the process in a series of step-by-step instructions that should guide you all the way to success.\n\nThis is my first attempt to creating an online course so bear with me if it's not the best. I love feedback and even if you absolutely hate it, let me know; but hopefully you'll enjoy this ride and you'll get to learn something new. Yes, I'm a n00b!\n\nIf you find typos, mistakes or plain wrong concepts please be kind and tell me so that I can fix them and we all get to learn!\n\nThanks to Natalia's brilliant idea, there's now a .epub version of the course that you can download from . As Natalia mentioned, this is for easier consumption of the content.

With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations. Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs. Standard methods facilitate such sequencing. In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.\n\nObjective: Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has substantial benefit in design of improved clinical tools and precise diagnostics. As examples of such applications, (i) Any medical or public health analysis relying on high throughput sequencing data to track SARS-COV2 and its variants would benefit from knowledge of vaccine sequences in order to distinguish RNA sequencing reads coming from the vaccine from those of viral origin, and (ii) Diagnostic labs designing nucleic acid surveillance tests (like PCR or LAMP assays) can benefit from vaccine sequence information to avoid confusion between vaccinated and infected test subjects when analyzing assay results. \n\nDescription: For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use. To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction. Although our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA. Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations. We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable. But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation. For further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing. As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2). From these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly. This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out. Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets. The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference. RNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243). Numerous recent advances have resulted in approaches to minimize dsRNA (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30933724/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31900329/); nonetheless measurement remains a continued necessity. In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand. In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol. Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%). Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents actual dsRNA content in the original material. Despite the transience of RNA from any individual inoculation, these mRNA vaccines and their derivatives will likely continue to be manufactured and administered as key tools for taming the ongoing COVID pandemic. In such context, this work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.\n\nProtoAcknowledgements: We thank our colleagues here for their help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Nelson Hall, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Marc Salit), and additionally acknowledge numerous colleagues who have discussed and educated us (directly and indirectly) in areas of RNA synthesis enzymology, vaccine design, and software engineering.\n\nFigure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine. Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled cDNA-derived contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the vaccine RNA and would lack any indication of base modifications. Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/]. The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.  \n\nFigure 2: Spike-encoding contig assembled from Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine.

For example, you can set rules for the required codecs, containers, languages etc that your media should have which helps keeps things organized and can increase compatability with your devices. A common use for Tdarr is to simply convert video files from h264 to h265 (hevc), saving 40%-50% in size.\n\nThe application is in the form of a click-to-run web-app, comprised of the following 2 components:\n\n- **Tdarr_Server**: Central process which all Nodes connect with\n- **Tdarr_Node**: Processes running on same/other devices which collect tasks from the Server\n\nPut your spare hardware to use with Tdarr Nodes for Windows, Linux (including Linux arm/arm64) and macOS.\n\nDesigned to work alongside applications like Sonarr/Radarr and built with the aim of modularisation, parallelisation and scalability, each library you add has its own transcode settings, filters and schedule. Workers can be fired up and closed down as necessary, and are split into 4 types: Transcode CPU/GPU and Health Check CPU/GPU. Worker limits can be managed by the scheduler as well as manually. For a desktop application with similar functionality, please see [Tdarr Desktop](https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr_Desktop).\n\n**Cross-platform Tdarr Nodes** which work together with Tdarr Server to process your files. GPU and CPU workers\n\n**Use/create Tdarr Plugins for infinite control on how your files are processed:** [Tdarr Plugins](https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr_Plugins)\n\nAudio and video library management\n\n- 7 day, 24 hour scheduler\n- Folder watcher\n- Worker stall detector\n- Load balancing between libraries/drives\n- Use HandBrake or FFmpeg\n- Tested on a 1,000,000 file dummy library\n- Search for files based on hundreds of properties\n- Library stats\n- Hardware transcoding container (install Nvidia plugin on unRAID/Nvidia runtime container on Ubuntu)\n\n![wRV6tBJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/wRV6tBJ.png)\n\nTdarr is extremely modular/configurable and the main idea behind it is creating a plugin stack to clean up/standardise your files. For example, a typical plugin stack might look like this:\n\n1. Transcode non hevc files into hevc\n2. Remove subs\n3. Remove meta data (if title)\n4. Add aac stereo audio if none (eng preferred)\n5. Remove closed captions\n\nIn this example, plugins 1,2,3 and 5 are community plugins which are available for you to use immediately. Plugin 4 can be created in the plugin creator interface in Tdarr and will appear as a local plugin.\n\nEach of the plugins are conditional, so are only used if needed. They are located in Tdarr/Documents and are written in JavaScript so if none of the plugins do what you want then you can modify/create new plugins if you have a bit of coding experience (or get the gist from having a look). Steps for doing so are in the README here: [Tdarr Plugins README](https://github.com/HaveAGitGat/Tdarr_Plugins). Ask for help in the Discord channel if need be.\n\nHere is an illustration of how the plugin stack works:\n\nFor the term 'streams', here is an example of how a file appears in Tdarr search results:\n\nThis file has 3 streams: a video, audio and subtitle stream. Subtitles and closed captions are very different. Where is the closed caption data in this example? It's embedded inside the h264 video stream.\n\nExtra streams and closed captions which you don't need can cause problems with direct playing and syncing files, so you might as well remove them (it's recommended to use something like Bazarr for subtitles). Even when playing files in programs such as VLC or Kodi, subtitles/closed captions can cause playback delays and make things stuttery for a few seconds when jumping around the video.\n\nExtra streams can also take up a lot of space. Don't be surprised to see some files in your library with 15 audio/commentary/subtitle tracks in a bunch of different languages. These can take up an extra GB per file.\n\nThe plugin creator is split into 'Filters' and 'Actions'. Filters encapsulate the actions, so the actions will only be carried out if the filter conditions are met.\n\n**Current filters:**\n\n- Filter by codec\n- Filter by medium\n- Filter by age\n- Filter by resolution\n- Filter by size\n\n**Current actions:**\n\n- Transcode HandBrake basic options\n- Transcode HandBrake/FFmpeg custom arguments\n- Transcode Standardise audio stream codecs\n- Transcode Add audio stream\n- Transcode Keep one audio stream\n- Remux container\n\nSome actions/plugins have built-in filters (specified in the plugin creator). This means they'll automatically detect if a file needs to be processed or not (such as the remove subtitles community plugin). Additional filters can be added.\n\nSome of the actions have become quite complicated so take a bit more time. For example, the 'Keep one audio stream' has 16 different outcomes as it tries to determine the best audio stream to keep based on the codec, language and channel count you specify.\n\nIf you have a request for a new filter/action, then try and think of it generically so I can implement it in a way that other people can configure and apply it to their (slightly) different circumstances. Request on GitHub, Reddit or Discord.\n\nFor example, to maximize direct play, a plugin stack like this can be used:\n\n1. If not in h264, transcode into h264 [h264 is a more universal video codec than others]\n2. If not in mp4, remux into mp4 [mp4 is the most universal container]\n3. Remove subs\n4. Remove closed captions\n5. Add aac stereo audio if none (eng preferred) [very universal audio codec/channel count]\n6. Remove meta-data if title meta detected [Stops annoying titles appearing in Plex]\""

They all support mTLS and data checking.\n  - **MySQL**: Connect to a MySQL server and run the `SHOW STATUS` SQL.\n  - **Redis**: Connect to a Redis server and run the `PING` command.\n  - **Memcache**: Connect to a Memcache server and run the `version` command or validate a given key/value pair.\n  - **MongoDB**: Connect to a MongoDB server and perform a ping.\n  - **Kafka**: Connect to a Kafka server and perform a list of all topics.\n  - **PostgreSQL**: Connect to a PostgreSQL server and run `SELECT 1` SQL.\n  - **Zookeeper**: Connect to a Zookeeper server and run `get /` command.\n\nEaseProbe supports notification delivery to the following:\n\n- **Slack**: Using Slack Webhook for notification delivery\n- **Discord**: Using Discord Webhook for notification delivery\n- **Telegram**: Using Telegram Bot for notification delivery\n- **Teams**: Support the notification delivery\n- **Email**: Support email notification delivery to one or more email addresses\n- **AWS SNS**: Support the AWS Simple Notification Service\n- **WeChat Work**: Support Enterprise WeChat Work notification delivery\n- **DingTalk**: Support the DingTalk notification delivery\n- **Lark**: Support the Lark(Feishu) notification delivery\n- **SMS**: SMS notification delivery with support for multiple SMS service providers\n  - **Log**: Write the notification into a log file or Syslog.\n  - **Shell**: Run a shell command to deliver the notification\n  - **RingCentral**: Using RingCentral Webhook for notification delivery\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> 1) The notification is **Edge-Triggered Mode** by default, if you want to config it as **Level-Triggered Mode** with different interval and max notification, please refer to the manual.\n>\n> 2) Windows platforms do not support syslog as notification method.\n\nCheck the [Documentation](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/README.md) to see how to configure it.\n\nEaseProbe supports the following report and metrics:\n\n- **SLA Report Notify**: EaseProbe would send the daily, weekly, or monthly SLA report using the defined `notify:` methods.\n- **SLA Live Report**: The EaseProbe would listen on the `0.0.0.0:8181` port by default. By accessing this service you will be provided with a live SLA report either as HTML at `http://localhost:8181/` or as JSON at `http://localhost:8181/api/v1/sla`\n- **SLA Data Persistence**: The SLA data will be persisted in `$CWD/data/data.yaml` by default. You can configure this path by editing the `settings` section of your configuration file.\n\nFor more information, please check the [Documentation](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/README.md).\n\n**Prometheus Metrics**: The EaseProbe would listen on the `8181` port by default. By accessing this service you will be provided with Prometheus metrics at `http://easeprobe:8181/metrics`.\n\nThe metrics are prefixed with `easeprobe_` and are documented in [Prometheus Metrics Documentation](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/prometheus.md).\n\nYou can get started with EaseProbe, by any of the following methods:\nDownload the release for your platform from https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/releases\nUse the available EaseProbe docker image `docker run -it megaease/easeprobe`\nBuild `easeprobe` from sources\n\nCompiler `Go 1.21+` (Generics Programming Support), checking the [Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to see how to install Go on your platform.\n\nUse `make` to build and produce the `easeprobe` binary file. The executable is produced under the `build/bin` directory.\n\nRead the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/config.md) for detailed instructions on how to configure all EaseProbe parameters.\n\nCreate a configuration file (eg. `$CWD/config.yaml`) using the configuration template at [Configuration Template](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/config/config.yaml), which includes the complete list of configuration parameters.\n\nThe following simple configuration example can be used to get started:\n\n```yaml\nprobe:\n  - name: \"example_http\"\n    type: \"http\"\n    endpoint: \"http://example.com\"\n    interval: \"10s\"\n    timeout: \"5s\"\n```\n\nYou can check the [JSON Scheme](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/json_schema.md) section to use a JSON Scheme file to make your life easier when you edit the configuration file.\n\nYou can run the following command to start EaseProbe once built\n\n```sh\n./build/bin/easeprobe -f config.yaml -d\n```\n\n- `-f` configuration file or URL or path for multiple files which will be automatically merged into one. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_CONFIG`\n- `-d` dry run. Can also be achieved by setting the environment variable `PROBE_DRY`\n\nEaseProbe can be deployed by Systemd, Docker, Docker-Compose, & Kubernetes.\n\nYou can find the details in [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/deploy.md).\n\nFor detailed instructions and features please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/README.md).\n\nWe have performed an extensive benchmark on EaseProbe. For the benchmark results please refer to [Benchmark Results](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/benchmark.md).\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the project, please spare a moment to read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/megaease/easeprobe/blob/main/docs/contributing.md).\n\nJoin Slack [EaseProbe Channel](https://slack.megaease.com/) for requirements, issues, and development.\n\nEaseProbe is under the Apache 2.0 license.

Automatically creates metrics for .  Includes simple JSON status page.  **Now part of the CNCF!*Kuberhealthy lets you continuously verify that your applications and Kubernetes clusters are working as expected. By creating a custom resource (a ) in your cluster, you can easily enable  and get Prometheus metrics for them.\n\nKuberhealthy comes with  to ensure the core functionality of Kubernetes, but checks can be used to test anything you like.  We encourage you to  in any language to test your own applications.  It really is quick and easy!\n\nKuberhealthy serves the status of all checks on a simple JSON status page, a  metrics endpoint (at `/metrics`), and supports InfluxDB metric forwarding for integration into your choice of alerting solution.\n\nKuberhealthy requires Kubernetes 1.16 or above.  \n\n\n\nIf you just want the rendered default specs without Helm, you can  or the  or even the .\n\nHere are the one-line installation commands for those same specs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have Prometheus\n\n\n\nIf you have Prometheus via Prometheus Operator:\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter installation, Kuberhealthy will only be available from within the cluster (`Type: ClusterIP`) at the service URL `kuberhealthy.kuberhealthy`.  To expose Kuberhealthy to clients outside of the cluster, you **must*edit the service `kuberhealthy` and set `Type: LoadBalancer` or otherwise expose the service yourself.\n\nYou can edit the Kuberhealthy configmap as well and it will be automatically reloaded by Kuberhealthy.  All configmap options are set to their defaults to make configuration easy.\n\n`kubectl edit -n kuberhealthy configmap kuberhealthy`\n\nYou can see checks that are configured with `kubectl -n kuberhealthy get khcheck`.  Check status can be accessed by the JSON status page endpoint, or via `kubectl -n kuberhealthy get khstate`.\n\nTo configure Kuberhealthy after installation, see the .\n\nDetails on using the helm chart are .  The Helm installation of Kuberhealthy is automatically updated to use the latest .\n\nMore installation options, including static yaml files are available in the  directory. These flat spec files contain the most recent changes to Kuberhealthy, or the master branch. Use this if you would like to test master branch updates.\n\nHere is an illustration of how Kuberhealthy provisions and operates checker pods.  The following process is illustrated:\n\nAn admin creates a  resource that calls for a synthetic Kubernetes daemonset to be deployed and tested every 15 minutes.  This will ensure that all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster can provision containers properly.\nKuberhealthy observes this new `KuberhealthyCheck` resource.\nKuberhealthy schedules a checker pod to manage the lifecycle of this check.\nThe checker pod creates a daemonset using the Kubernetes API.\nThe checker pod observes the daemonset and waits for all daemonset pods to become `Ready`\nThe checker pod deletes the daemonset using the Kubernetes API.\nThe checker pod observes the daemonset being fully cleaned up and removed.\nThe checker pod reports a successful test result back to Kuberhealthy's API.\nKuberhealthy stores this check's state and makes it available to various metrics systems.\n\n<img src=\"images/kh-ds-check.gif\">\n\nYou can use any of  by simply enabling them.  By default Kuberhealthy comes with several checks to test Kubernetes deployments, daemonsets, and DNS.\n\nchecks SSL certificate validity and warns when certs are about to expire.\nchecks for events indicating that a CronJob has failed to create Job pods.\nchecks that an image can be pulled from an image repository.\nverifies that a fresh deployment can run, deploy multiple pods, pass traffic, do a rolling update (without dropping connections), and clean up successfully.\nverifies that a daemonset can be created, fully provisioned, and torn down.  This checks the full kubelet functionality of every node in your Kubernetes cluster.\nverifies that a pod with persistent storage can be configured on every node in your cluster.\n\nYou can easily create synthetic tests to check your applications and APIs with real world use cases. This is a great way to be confident that your application functions as expected in the real world at all times.\n\nHere is a full check example written in `go`.  Just implement `doCheckStuff` and you're off!\n\nYou can read more about  and . Checks can be written in any language and helpful clients for checks not written in Go can be found in the .\n\nYou can directly access the current test statuses by accessing the `kuberhealthy.kuberhealthy` HTTP service on port The status page displays server status in the format shown below.  The boolean `OK` field can be used to indicate global up/down status, while the `Errors` array will contain a list of all check error descriptions.  Granular, per-check information, including how long the check took to run (Run Duration), the last time a check was run, and the Kuberhealthy pod ran that specific check is available under the `CheckDetails` object.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to this project:\nCheck out the .\nIf you use Kuberhealthy in a production environment, add yourself to the list of !\nCheck out . If you're new to the project, look for the `good first issue` tag.\nWe're always looking for check contributions (either in suggestions or in PRs) as well as feedback from folks implementing\nKuberhealthy locally or in a test environment.\n\nWhile working on Kuberhealthy, you can take advantage of the included  dev \nenvironment to get Go & other tooling without having to install them separately on your local machine.\n\nJust use the following command to activate the environment, and you're good to go:\n\nIf you would like to talk directly to the core maintainers to discuss ideas, code reviews, or other complex issues, we have a monthly Zoom meeting on the **24th day*of every month at **04:30 PM Pacific Time**.  \n\nor\""

As a result, you might no longer need to use this tool and can use the native Kubernetes feature instead.\n>\n> This tool can still be useful if you are on older versions of Kubernetes,\n> or using advanced configuration (such as custom metadata, TLS or finer timeout tuning),\n> or not using Kubernetes at all.\n\nThis command-line utility makes a RPC to `/grpc.health.v1.Health/Check`. If it\nresponds with a `SERVING` status, the `grpc_health_probe` will exit with\nsuccess, otherwise it will exit with a non-zero exit code (documented below).\n\n**EXAMPLES***It is recommended*to use a version-stamped binary distribution:\n\nChoose a binary from the [Releases][rel] page.\n\nInstalling from source (not recommended):\n\nMake sure you have `git` and `go` installed.\nRun: `go install github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe@latest`\nThis will compile the binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`).\n\n\n\nTo make use of the `grpc_health_probe`, your application must implement the\n[gRPC Health Checking Protocol v1][hc]. This means you must to register the\n`Health` service and implement the `rpc Check` that returns a `SERVING` status.\n\nSince the Health Checking protocol is part of the gRPC core, it has\npackages/libraries available for the languages supported by gRPC:\n\n]\n]\n]\n]\n/]\n] ...\n\nMost of the languages listed above provide helper functions that hides\nimplementation details. This eliminates the need for you to implement the\n`Check` rpc yourself.\n\n\n\nKubernetes now supports [gRPC health checking][k8s]. If your cluster is running a version that supports gRPC health checking, you can define a gRPC liveness probe in your Pod specification. For more information on how to define a gRPC liveness probe in Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation][k8s-new].\n\nHowever, if your Kubernetes version does not support gRPC health checking or if you want to use some advanced features that Kubernetes does not support, you can use `grpc_health_probe` to health-check your gRPC server. As a solution, \n`grpc_health_probe` [can be used for Kubernetes][k8s] to health-check gRPC\nservers running in the Pod.\n\nYou are recommended to use [Kubernetes `exec` probes][execprobe] and define\nliveness and/or readiness checks for your gRPC server pods.\n\nYou can bundle the statically compiled `grpc_health_probe` in your container\nimage. Choose a [binary release][rel] and download it in your Dockerfile:\n\n\n\nIn your Kubernetes Pod specification manifest, specify a `livenessProbe` and/or\n`readinessProbe` for the container:\n\n\n\nThis approach provide proper readiness/liveness checking to your applications\nthat implement the [gRPC Health Checking Protocol][hc].\n\n\n\nIf a gRPC server is serving traffic over TLS, or uses TLS client authentication\nto authorize clients, you can still use `grpc_health_probe` to check health\nwith command-line options:\n\n| Option | Description |\n|:------------|-------------|\n| **`-tls`*| use TLS (default: false) |\n| **`-tls-ca-cert`*| path to file containing CA certificates (to override system root CAs) |\n| **`-tls-client-cert`*| client certificate for authenticating to the server |\n| **`-tls-client-key`*| private key for for authenticating to the server |\n| **`-tls-no-verify`*| use TLS, but do not verify the certificate presented by the server (INSECURE) (default: false) |\n| **`-tls-server-name`*| override the hostname used to verify the server certificate |\n\n\n\nIf your gRPC server requires authentication, you can use the following command line options and set the \n[SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET][spiffe-socket]\nenvironment variable.\n\n| Option | Description |\n|:------------|-------------|\n| **`-spiffe`*| use [SPIFFE Workload API][spiffe] to retrieve TLS credentials (default: false) |\n\n\n\n| Option | Description |\n|:------------|-------------|\n| **`-v`*| verbose logs (default: false) |\n| **`-connect-timeout`*| timeout for establishing connection |\n| **`-rpc-timeout`*| timeout for health check rpc |\n| **`-rpc-header`*| sends metadata in the RPC request context (default: empty map) |\n| **`-user-agent`*| user-agent header value of health check requests (default: grpc_health_probe) |\n| **`-service`*| service name to check (default: \"\") empty \""

This repository holds a number of scripts to manage RouterOS devices or extend their functionality.\n\n*Use at your own risk*, pay attention to!\n\nRequirements\n-----------\nLatest version of the scripts require recent RouterOS to function properly.\nMake sure to install latest updates before you begin. If new functionality or a breaking change in RouterOS `7.n` is used in my scripts I push my change some time after `7.(n+1)` was released. At any time you should have at least two minor and their bugfix releases to choose from.\n\nSpecific scripts may require even newer RouterOS version.\n\n> ℹ️ **Info**: The `main` branch is now RouterOS v7 only. If you are still running RouterOS v6 switch to `routeros-v6` branch!\n\nRouterOS packages increase in size with each release. This becomes a problem for devices with 16MB storage and below, those with an ARM CPU are specifically affected.\n\nHuge configuration and lots of scripts give an extra risk. **Take care!**\n\nInitial setup\n------------\nIf you know how things work just copy and paste the . Remember to edit and rerun `global-config-overlay`!\nFirst time users should take the long way below.\n\nWant to see it in action? I've had a presentation [Repository based RouterOS script distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9neG3oAhcY) including demonstation recorded live at [MUM Europe 2019](https://mum.mikrotik.com/2019/EU/) in Vienna.\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning**: Some details changed. So see the presentation, then follow the steps below for up-to-date commands.\n\nThe update script does server certificate verification, so first step is to download the certificates. If you intend to download the scripts from a different location (for example from github.com) install the corresponding certificate chain.\n\n    /tool/fetch \"https://git.eworm.de/cgit/routeros-scripts/plain/certs/ISRG-Root-X2.pem\" dst-path=\"isrg-root-x2.pem\";\n\nNote that the commands above do *not* verify server certificate, so if you want to be safe download with your workstation's browser and transfer the file to your MikroTik device.\n\nThen we import the certificate.\n\n    /certificate/import file-name=isrg-root-x2.pem passphrase=\"\";\n\nDo not worry that the command is not shown that happens because it contains a sensitive property, the passphrase.\n\nFor basic verification we rename the certificate and print it by fingerprint. Make sure exactly this one certificate (\"ISRG-Root-X2\") is shown.\n\n    /certificate/set name=\"ISRG-Root-X2\" [ find where common-name=\"ISRG Root X2\" ];\n    /certificate/print proplist=name,fingerprint where fingerprint=\"69729b8e15a86efc177a57afb7171dfc64add28c2fca8cf1507e34453ccb1470\";\n\nAlways make sure there are no certificates installed you do not know or want!\n\nAll following commands will verify the server certificate. For validity the certificate's lifetime is checked with local time, so make sure the device's date and time is set correctly!\n\nNow let's download the main scripts and add them in configuration on the fly.\n\n    :foreach Script in={ \"global-config\"; \"global-config-overlay\"; \"global-functions\" } do={ /system/script/add name=$Script owner=$Script source=([ /tool/fetch check-certificate=yes-without-crl (\"https://git.eworm.de/cgit/routeros-scripts/plain/\" . $Script . \".rsc\") output=user as-value]->\"data\"); };\n\nAnd finally load configuration and functions and add the scheduler.\n\n    /system/script { run global-config; run global-functions; };\n    /system/scheduler/add name=\"global-scripts\" start-time=startup on-event=\"/system/script { run global-config; run global-functions; }\";\n\nThe last step is optional: Add this scheduler **only** if you want the scripts to be updated automatically!\n\n    /system/scheduler/add name=\"ScriptInstallUpdate\" start-time=startup interval=1d on-event=\":global ScriptInstallUpdate; \\$ScriptInstallUpdate;\";\n\nEditing configuration\n--------------------\nThe configuration needs to be tweaked for your needs. Edit `global-config-overlay`, copy relevant configuration from (the one without `-overlay`). Save changes and exit with `Ctrl-o`.\n\n    /system/script/edit global-config-overlay source;\n\nAdditionally creating configuration snippets is supported. The script name of these snippets has to start with `global-config-overlay.d/` to make them being loaded automatically. This allows to split off parts of the configuration.\n\nTo apply your changes run `global-config`, which will automatically load the overlay as well:\n\n    /system/script/run global-config;\n\nThis last step is required whenever you make changes to your configuration.\n\n> ℹ️ **Info**: It is recommended to edit the configuration using the command line interface. If using Winbox on Windows OS, the line endings may be missing. To fix this run:\n> `/system/script/set source=[ :tocrlf [ get global-config-overlay source ] ] global-config-overlay;`\n\nUpdating scripts\n---------------\nTo update existing scripts just run function `$ScriptInstallUpdate`. If everything is up-to-date it will not produce any output.\n\n    $ScriptInstallUpdate;\n\nIf the update includes news or requires configuration changes a notification is sent in addition to terminal output and log messages.\n\nAdding a script\n--------------\nTo add a script from the repository run function `$ScriptInstallUpdate` with a comma separated list of script names.\n\n    $ScriptInstallUpdate check-certificates,check-routeros-update;\n\nScheduler and events\n-------------------\nMost scripts are designed to run regularly from . We just added `check-routeros-update`, so let's run it daily to make sure not to miss an update.\n\n    /system/scheduler/add name=\"check-routeros-update\" interval=1d start-time=startup on-event=\"/system/script/run check-routeros-update;\";\n\nSome events can run a script.

When you get back a response that\nincludes one or more problems, you can then decide the appropriate course of\naction, which could include generating notifications and/or automating the\nreplacement of a failing node with a new one. If you are monitoring health in a\nhigh-availability environment with a load balancer that returns responses from\nmultiple nodes, please note that certain checks (e.g., disk and memory usage)\nwill return responses specific to the node selected by the load balancer.\n\n\n\nWe officially only support the latest version of Python as well as the\nlatest version of Django and the latest Django LTS version.\n\n\n\nFirst, install the `django-health-check` package:\n\n\n\nAdd the health checker to a URL you want to use:\n\n\n\nAdd the `health_check` applications to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:\n\n\n\n**Note:** If using `boto 2.x.x` use `health_check.contrib.s3boto_storage`\n\n(Optional) If using the `psutil` app, you can configure disk and memory\nthreshold settings; otherwise below defaults are assumed.

For example:\n\n\n\nTo use the Redis healthcheck, please make sure that there is a variable named `REDIS_URL`\non django.conf.settings with the required format to connect to your redis server. For example:\n\n\n\nThe cache healthcheck tries to write and read a specific key within the cache backend.\nIt can be customized by setting `HEALTHCHECK_CACHE_KEY` to another value:\n\n\n\n\nYou can use tools like Pingdom, StatusCake or other uptime robots to monitor service status.\nThe `/ht/` endpoint will respond with an HTTP 200 if all checks passed\nand with an HTTP 500 if any of the tests failed.\nGetting machine-readable JSON reports\n\nIf you want machine-readable status reports you can request the `/ht/`\nendpoint with the `Accept` HTTP header set to `application/json`\nor pass `format=json` as a query parameter.\n\nThe backend will return a JSON response:\n\n\n\nWriting a health check is quick and easy:\n\n\n\nAfter writing a custom checker, register it in your app configuration:\n\n\n\nMake sure the application you write the checker into is registered in your\n`INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n\n\nYou can customize HTML or JSON rendering by inheriting from `MainView` in\n`health_check.views` and customizing the `template_name`, `get`, `render_to_response`\nand `render_to_response_json` properties:\n\n\n\nYou can run the Django command `health_check` to perform your health checks via the command line,\nor periodically with a cron, as follow:\n\n\n\nThis should yield the following output:\n\n\n\nSimilar to the http version, a critical error will cause the command to quit with the exit code `1`.\""

SQLite is a light weight database that doesn't require a server.\n\nWhat they can do:\nAutomatically download and import Garmin daily monitoring files (all day heart rate, activity, climb/descend, stress, and intensity minutes) from the user's Garmin Connect \"Daily Summary\" page.\nExtract sleep, weight, and resting heart rate data from Garmin Connect, store it as JSON files, and import it into the DB.\nDownload and import activity files from Garmin Connect. A summary table for all activities and more detailed data for some activity types. Lap and record entries for activities.\nSummarizing data into a DB with tables containing daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries.\nGraph your data from the commandline or with Jupyter notebooks.\nRetain downloaded JSON and FIT files so that the DB can be regenerated without connecting to or redownloading data from Garmin Connect.\nExport activities as TCX files.\n\nOnce you have your data in the DB, I recommend using a supplied Jupyter notebooks, third party Jupyter notebooks, and/or SQLite browser like , , or  for browsing and working with the data. The scripts create some default views in the DBs that make browsing the data easier.\n\nGarminDb releases are hosted on . GarminDb requires Python 3.x. With Python installed, install the latest release with  by running `pip install garmindb` in a terminal.\nCopy  to `~/.GarminDb/GarminConnectConfig.json`, edit it, and add your Garmin Connect username and password and adjust the start dates to match the dates of your data in Garmin Connect.\nStarting out: download all of your data and create your db by running `garmindb_cli.py --all --download --import --analyze` in a terminal.\nIncrementally update your db by downloading the latest data and importing it by running `garmindb_cli.py --all --download --import --analyze --latest` in a terminal.\nOcassionally run `garmindb_cli.py --backup` to backup your DB files.\n\nUpdate to the latest release with `pip install --upgrade garmindb`.\n\nThe scripts are automated with Make. Run the Make commands in a terminal window.\n\nGit clone GarminDB repo using the . The submodules require you to use SSH and not HTTPS. Get the command from the green button on the project home page.\nRun `make setup` in the cloned tree to get the scripts ready to process data.\nCopy  to `~/.GarminDb/GarminConnectConfig.json`, edit it, and add your Garmin Connect username and password and adjust the start dates to match the dates of your data in Garmin Connect.\nRun `make create_dbs` once to fetch and process for you data.\nKeep all of your local data up to date by periodically running only one command: `make`.\n\nThere is more help on Make in the wiki.\n\nJupyter notebooks for analzing data from the database can be found in the 'Jupyter' directory in the source tree. Third party Jupyter notebooks can be found in the wiki.\n\nPlugins allow the user to expand the types of data that are processed and stored in the database. GarminDb already has a number of plugins for handling data from third-party Connect IQ apps and data fields.

If you're using GarminDB and your scenario isn't listed send me a message or file an issue with your success case.\n\nYou may get a DB version exception after updating the code, this means that the DB schema was updated and you need to rebuild your DBs by running `garmindb_cli.py --rebuild_db`. Your DBs will be regenerated from the previously downloaded data files. All of your data will not be redownloaded from Garmin.\nThe scripts were developed on MacOS. Information or patches on using these scripts on other platforms are welcome.\nWhen a database update finishes, a summary of the data in the DB will be saved to stats.txt. The output includes the date ranges included in the downloaded daily monitoring files and activities. It includes the number of records for daily monitoring, activities, sleep, resting heart rate, weight, etc. Use the summary information to determine if all of your data has been downloaded from Garmin Connect. If not, adjust the dates in GarminConnectConfig.json and runt he download again.\n\nIn `GarminConnectConfig.json` the \"steps\" element of the \"course_views\" is list of course ids that per course database views will be generated for. The database view allows you to compare all activities from that course.\n\nIf you have issues, file a bug here on the project. See the Issues tab at the top of the project page. Run `make bugreport` or `garmindb_bug_report.py` and include bugreport.txt in your bug report.\nBesides errors that appear on the screen, one of the first places to look for more information is the log files (garmindb.log).\nIf you're having issues with a particular data files, please considering sharing so I can debug it and add support.\n\nPlease submit a pull request targeting the develop branch and add your self to the contributors file. Run `make flake8` at the top level and fix all errors before submitting your pull request.\""

It runs locally on the boxes which make up a distributed system, and reports state information to a distributed key-value store. At Airbnb, we use Zookeeper as our key-value store. The combination of Nerve and  make service discovery in the cloud easy!\n\nWe already use  to discover remote services. However, those services needed boilerplate code to register themselves in . Nerve simplifies underlying services, enables code reuse, and allows us to create a more composable system. It does so by factoring out the boilerplate into it's own application, which independently handles monitoring and reporting.\n\nBeyond those benefits, nerve also acts as a general watchdog on systems. The information it reports can be used to take action from a centralized automation center: action like scaling distributed systems up or down or alerting ops or engineering about downtime.\n\nTo download and run the nerve binary, first install a version of ruby. Then, install nerve with:\n\n```\ngem install nerve\n```\n\nThis will download nerve and its dependencies into /opt/smartstack/nerve. You might wish to omit the `--install-dir` flag to use your system's default gem path, however this will require you to run `gem install nerve` with root permissions. You can also install via bundler, but keep in mind you'll pick up Nerve's version of library dependencies and possibly not the ones you need for your infra/apps.\n\nYou can now run the nerve binary like:\n\n```\nnerve -c /opt/smartstack/nerve/nerve.conf.json\n```\n\nNerve depends on a single configuration file, in json format. It is usually called `nerve.conf.json`. An example config file is available in `example/nerve.conf.json`. The config file is composed of two main sections:\n\n`instance_id`: the name nerve will submit when registering services; makes debugging easier\n`heartbeat_path`: a path to a file on disk to touch as nerve makes progress. This allows you to work around https://github.com/zk-ruby/zk/issues/50 by restarting a stuck nerve.\n`services`: the hash (from service name to config) of the services nerve will be monitoring\n`service_conf_dir`: path to a directory in which each json file will be interpreted as a service with the basename of the file minus the .json extension\n\nEach service that nerve will be monitoring is specified in the `services` hash. The key is the name of the service, and the value is a configuration hash telling nerve how to monitor the service. The configuration contains the following options:\n\n`host`: the default host on which to make service checks; you should make this your *publicip to ensure your service is publicly accessible\n`port`: the default port for service checks; nerve will report the `host`:`port` combo via your chosen reporter\n`reporter_type`: the mechanism used to report up/down information; depending on the reporter you choose, additional parameters may be required. Defaults to `zookeeper`\n`check_interval`: the frequency with which service checks will be initiated; defaults to `500ms`\n`check_mocked`: whether or not health check is mocked, the host check always returns healthy and report up when the value is true\n`checks`: a list of checks that nerve will perform; if all of the pass, the service will be registered; otherwise, it will be un-registered\n`rate_limiting` (optional): a hash containing the configuration for rate limiting (see 'Rate Limiting' below)\n`weight` (optional): a positive integer weight value which can be used to affect the haproxy backend weighting in synapse.\n`haproxy_server_options` (optional): a \""

It can be used by servers, microservices, and other services to determine the availability of an application.\n\nRather than simply returning a response with HTTP status code 200, this library allows building health checks that test the availability of all required dependencies. The HTTP response contains the aggregated health result and details about the health status of each component.\n\nBecause our search component is down, the request curl http://localhost:3000/health would yield a response with HTTP status code 503 (Service Unavailable), and the following JSON response body:\n\nshows all features of this library.\n\nWith \"synchronous\" health checks, we mean that every HTTP request initiates a health check and waits until all check functions complete before returning an aggregated health result. You can configure synchronous checks using the WithCheck configuration option (see ).\n\nSynchronous checks can be sufficient for smaller applications but might not scale well for more involved applications. Sometimes an application needs to read a large amount of data, can experience latency issues or make an expensive calculation to tell something about its health. With synchronous health checks, the application will not be able to respond quickly to health check requests (see why this is necessary to avoid service disruptions in modern cloud infrastructure).\n\nRather than executing health check functions on every HTTP request, periodic (or \"asynchronous\") health checks execute the check function on a fixed schedule. With this approach, the health status is always read from a local cache that is regularly updated in the background. This allows responding to HTTP requests instantly without waiting for check functions to complete.\n\nPeriodic checks can be configured using the WithPeriodicCheck configuration option (see ).\n\nThis library allows you to mix synchronous and asynchronous check functions, so you can start out simple and easily transition into a more scalable and robust health check implementation later.\n\nHealth check results are cached to avoid sending too many requests to the services that your program checks and to mitigate \"denial of service\" attacks. The cache duration is set to 1 second by default. If you do not want to use caching altogether, you can disable it using the health.WithDisabledCache() configuration option.\n\nIt can be useful to react to health status changes. For example, you might want to log status changes or adjust some metrics, so you can easier correlate logs during root cause analysis or perform actions to mitigate the impact of an unhealthy component.\n\nThis library allows you to configure listener functions that will be called when either the overall/aggregated health status changes, or that of a specific component.\n\nIt can be useful to hook into the checking lifecycle to do some processing before and after a health check. For example, you might want to add some tracing information to the request before the check function executes, do some logging or modify the check result before sending the HTTP response (e.g., removing details on failed authentication).\n\nThis library provides two mechanisms that allow you to hook into processing:\n\ngives you the possibility to intercept all calls of health, which corresponds to every incoming HTTP request. In contrast to the usually used middleware, this middleware allows you to access check related information and post-process a check result before sending it in an HTTP response.\n\nMiddleware | Description\n--- | ---\nAuth | Reduces exposed health details based on authentication success. Uses OAuth2 for authentication.\nBasicAuth | Same as BasicAuth middleware, but allows using an arbitrary function for authentication.\nDisable | Disables health details unless the request contains a previously configured query parameter name.\nLog | Basic request-oriented logging functionality.\n\nmake it possible to intercept all calls to a check function. This is useful if you have cross-functional code that needs to be reusable and should have access to check state information.\n\nInterceptor | Description\n--- | ---\nLogComponent | Basic component check function logging functionality\n\nMost existing Go health check libraries come with their own implementations of tool-specific check functions (such as for Redis, memcached, Postgres, etc.). Rather than reinventing the wheel and come up with yet another library-specific implementation of check functions, the goal was to design this library in a way that makes it easy to reuse existing solutions. The following (non-exhaustive) list of health check implementations should work with this library without or minimal adjustments:\n\n(see)\n\n(see)\n\n(see)\n\n(see)\n\nhealth is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the MIT Public License.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The more dependencies you add, the longer your health check will take to complete (and potentially cause your service to be killed off by the orchestration platform). Depending on the complexity of a given dependency, your check may be fairly involved where it is okay for it to take 30s+ to complete.\nIt adds unnecessary load on yours deps or at worst, becomes a DoS target. Non-malicious scenario: Thundering herd problem - in the event of a deployment (or restart, etc.), all of your service containers are likely to have their /status endpoints checked by the orchestration platform as soon as they come up. Depending on the complexity of the checks, running that many simultaneous checks against your dependencies could cause at worst the dependencies to experience problems and at minimum add unnecessary load. Security scanners - if your organization runs periodic security scans, they may hit your /status endpoint and trigger unnecessary dep checks.\nMalicious scenario: Loading up any basic HTTP benchmarking tool and pointing it at your /status endpoint could choke your dependencies (and potentially your service).\n\nWith that said, not everyone needs asynchronous checks. If your service has one dependency (and that is unlikely to change), it is trivial to write a basic, synchronous check and it will probably suffice.\n\nHowever, if you anticipate that your service will have several dependencies, with varying degrees of complexity for determining their health state you should probably think about introducing asynchronous health checks.\n\nWriting an async health checking framework for your service is not a trivial task, especially if Go is not your primary language.\n\nThis library:\n\nAllows you to define how to check your dependencies.\nAllows you to define warning and fatal thresholds.\nWill run your dependency checks on a given interval, in the background. Exposes a way for you to gather the check results in a fast and thread-safe manner to help determine the final status of your /status endpoint. Comes bundled with checkers for well-known dependencies such as Redis, Mongo, HTTP and more.\nMakes it simple to implement and provide your own checkers (by adhering to the checker interface).\nAllows you to trigger listener functions when your health checks fail or recover using the .\nAllows you to run custom logic when a specific health check completes by using the .\n\nMake sure to run your checks on a \"sane\" interval. ie. if you are checking your Redis dependency once every five minutes, your service is essentially running blind for about 4.59/5 minutes. Unless you have a really good reason, check your dependencies every X seconds, rather than X minutes.\n\ngo-health continuously writes dependency health state data and allows you to query that data via .State(). Alternatively, you can use one of the pre-built HTTP handlers for your /healthcheck endpoint (and thus not have to manually inspect the state data).\n\nFor full examples, look through the Create an instance of health and configure a checker (or two) Register your check with your health instance Start the health check From here on, you can either configure an endpoint such as /healthcheck to use a built-in handler such as handlers.NewJSONHandlerFunc() or get the current health state of all your deps by traversing the data returned by h.State().\n\nAssuming you have configured go-health with two HTTP checkers, your /healthcheck output would look something like this:\n\nAt first glance it may seem that these two features provide the same functionality. However, they are meant for two different use cases:\n\nThe IStatusListener is useful when you want to run a custom function in the event that the overall status of your health checks change. I.E. if go-health is currently checking the health for two different dependencies A and B, you may want to trip a circuit breaker for A and/or B. You could also put your service in a state where it will notify callers that it is not currently operating correctly. The opposite can be done when your service recovers.\n\nThe OnComplete hook is called whenever a health check for an individual dependency is complete. This means that the function you register with the hook gets called every single time go-health completes the check. It's completely possible to register different functions with each configured health check or not to hook into the completion of certain health checks entirely. For instance, this can be useful if you want to perform cleanup after a complex health check or if you want to send metrics to your APM software when a health check completes. It is important to keep in mind that this hook effectively gets called on roughly the same interval you define for the health check.\n\nAll PR's are welcome, as long as they are well tested.

Now that Microsoft is rolling out their own, the Beatpulse project will be focused in contributing towards this library. All liveness, UI and Beatpulse features are already available as extensions for the new Microsoft health checks package in this repository:\n\nSupport: The team will continue to provide support to Beatpulse until version 3.0 with .Net Core version 2.1 but no new features will be added in this repository.\n\nWhat is Health Checking? Health checking is the process where load balancers or application delivery controller does periodic checks on our applications to make sure that they are up and responding without any problems. If our applications are down for whatever reason or any of the systems that our applications depends on (A database, a distributed cache, web service, etc) are down, the load balancer, k8s, should detect this and stop sending traffic its way trying to restore services manually or automatically.\n\nBeatPulse is a powerfull liveness, readiness library for .NET Core Applications with many out of box enterprise health check services.\n\nThis documentation is for BeatPulse latest version, you can check changes and package compatibility on .\n\nInstall the Nuget Package into your ASP.NET Core application.\n\nInstall the liveness libraries that you need on your project. At this moment BeatPulse contains NuGet libraries for:\n\nSystem (Disk Storage, Memory)\nNetwork (Tcp, Ftp, Sftp, Imap, Smtp, Dns resolve)\nRedis\nElasticsearch\nSqlServer\nMongoDb\nPostgress Sql\nEventStore\nOracle\nAzure Storage (Blobs, Tables and Queues)\nAzure Service Bus (Event Hub, Service Bus queues and topics)\nDocumentDb\nMySQL\nSqLite\nKafka\nRabbitMQ\nIdentity Server\nAWS DynamoDB\nCustom lambda liveness.\n\nAdd BeatPulse into your ASP.NET Core project. UseBeatPulse is a new IWebHostBuilder extension method to register and configure BeatPulse.\n\nAdd BeatPulseService and set the liveness libraries to be used.\n\nRequest BeatPulse to get liveness results.\n\nFor more information about BeatPulse configuration and other features (configuration, cache, authentication, etc) see the .\n\nWith TrackingPulses you can save liveness information in external services. Currently we have developed different trackers you can use:\n\nThe project BeatPulse.UI is a minimal UI interface that stores and shows the liveness results from the configured liveness uri's. To integrate BeatPulse.UI in your project you just need to add the BeatPulse.UI services and middlewares.\n\nThis automatically registers a new interface on /beatpulse-ui. Optionally, UseBeatPulseUI can be configured with different UI response path.\n\nBeatPulseUI is also available as a docker image. You can read more about .\n\nThe liveness to be used on BeatPulse-UI are configured using the BeatPulse-UI settings.\n\n1. Liveness: The collection of liveness uris to watch.\n2. EvaluationTimeOnSeconds: Number of elapsed seconds between liveness checks.\n3. Webhooks: If any liveness return a Down result, this collections will be used to notify the error status. (Payload is the json payload and must be scape. For mor information see Notifications section)\n4. MinimumSecondsBetweenFailureNotifications: The minimun seconds between failure notifications in order not flooding the notification receiver.\n\nAll liveness results are stored into a SqLite database persisted to disk with livenessdbname.\n\nIf the WebHooks section is configured, BeatPulse-UI automatically posts a new notification into the webhook collection. BeatPulseUI uses a simple replace method for values in the webhook's Payload property. At this moment we support two bookmarks:\n\n[LIVENESS] The name of the liveness that returns Down.\n[FAILURE] A detail message with the failure.\n\n contains more information and webhooks samples for Microsoft Teams, Azure Functions, Slack and more.\n\nBeatPulse wouldn't be possible without the time and effort of its contributors.

Writing in a journal with pen and paper is effective, but not as easily accessible, maintained, or preserved as taking advantage of digital platforms.\n\nHaving a journal that is available on any device makes journaling easier. Being tailored specifically to journaling makes it less cumbersome than trying to utilize a note taking app or document for recording thoughts and impressions.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 ways to get started using Sol Journal:\n\nYou can develop it locally after hooking it up to your own Firebase project by following the instructions below\nYou can host your own version and manage it yourself by following the \n\nSol Journal uses firebase to support offline functionality and authentication, meaning a new Firebase app will need to be setup with Firestore as a database if you wish to host it yourself. Be sure to add documents for `users` and `entries`, as well as enabling email for user authentication.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of minimalism, a few key features are in place for a quick, lightweight journaling experience that can work across devices, including:\n\n🔥 Authentication: Cloud firestore persists registered users to a users document and saved journal entries to an entries document\n🎨 Theming: the `src/styles/theme.js` file contains a set of colors and default styles that are applied to components with Emotion. A default light and dark theme are already in the file (adding  support would be a great future addition)\n🔍 Search: full-text search of a user's entries stored in Firestore for quick access to past entries\n🖥 Mobile Friendly: designed to look great on mobile as well as desktop, with easy navigation on both\n💡 PWA: being a progressive web app makes it installable from Chrome/Safari on desktop, or be added to the homescreen on iOS/Android\n🔌 Offline Support: read/write when you're offline and let the updates happen when your connection is restored\n🗄 Export: backup all of your entries at any time to save your data\n\n\n\nFiles are organized into these folders:\n\n`/components`: user interface pieces to construct the design and layout of the site  \n`/data`: local data transformed by Gatsby to become queryable by Gatsby's GraphQL data layer  \n`/img`: images used by places like landing pages that are optimized by gatsby-image and then queryable in the GraphQL layer  \n`/pages`: public pages that can be seen by unauthenticated users and are completely server side rendered by Gatsby during `gatsby build`  \n`/routes`: private, client only routes only visible to authenticated users that are used by the app section of the journal  \n`/styles`: role based design tokens and theme definitions  \n`/util`: simple utility functions, for things like formatting dates\n\n\n\nClone the project:\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nThen configure a file in a new `.env` file (using the `.env.sample` file as a reference) with the following keys from the firebase console:\n\n\n\nAgain, be sure to add documents for `users` and `entries`, as well as enabling email for user authentication.\n\nNavigate into the project directory, and then launch the site with this command:\n\n\n\nThe site will be opened up in your default browser on http://localhost:8000\n\nEdit code in the `/src`, save your changes, and they'll reload instantly in the browser.\n\n\n\nTo create an optimized build of the site run this command:\n\n\n\nA `/public` folder will be assembled that can be deployed to any static file hosting service like Netlify or surge.\n\nIt can be deployed to firebase with this command:\n\n\n\n\n\nSol Journal is inspired by  and borrows much of its design and navigation.\n\nIf you're interested in a comparable version of the project, you can check out  to the journaling block.\""

Available options:\n- `WithCheckListeners` enables you to act on check registration, start and completed events\n- `WithHealthListeners` enables you to act on changes in the health service results\n\nThe library comes with a set of built-in checks.\nCurrently implemented checks are as follows:\n\n### HTTP Check\nThe HTTP check allows you to trigger an HTTP request to one of your dependencies, and verify the response status, and optionally the content of the response body.\nExample was given above in the section\n\n### DNS Checks\nThe DNS checks allow you to perform lookup to a given hostname / domain name / CNAME / etc, and validate that it resolves to at least the minimum number of required results.\n\nCreating a host lookup check is easy:\n```go\n```\n\nYou may also use the low level `checks.NewResolveCheck` specifying a custom `LookupFunc` if you want to to perform other kinds of lookups. For example you may register a reverse DNS lookup check like so:\n```go\n```\n\n### Ping Checks\nThe ping checks allow you to verifies that a resource is still alive and reachable. For example, you can use it as a DB ping check (`sql.DB` implements the Pinger interface):\n```go\n```\n\nYou can also use the ping check to test a generic connection like so:\n```go\n```\n\nThe `NewDialPinger` function supports all the network/address parameters supported by the `net.Dial()` function(s)\n\n### Custom Checks\nThe library provides 2 means of defining a custom check.\nThe bottom line is that you need an implementation of the `Check` interface:\n\nSee examples in the following 2 sections below.\n\n#### Simple Custom Check\nThe `checksCustomCheck` struct implements the `checks.Check` interface, and is the simplest way to implement a check if all you need is to define a check function.\n\nLet's define a check function that fails 50% of the times:\n```go\n```\n\nNow we register the check to start running right away, and execute once per 2 minutes with a timeout of 5 seconds:\n```go\n```\n\n#### More Elaborate Custom Check\nSometimes you need to define a more elaborate custom check. For example when you need to manage state. For these cases it's best to implement the `Check` interface yourself.\n\nLet's define a flexible example of the lottery check, that allows you to define a fail probability:\n```go\n```\n\nAnd register our custom check, scheduling it to run every 30 seconds (after a 1 second initial delay) with a 5 seconds timeout:\n```go\n```\n\nIf a check take longer than the specified rate period, then next execution will be delayed, but will not be concurrently executed. Checks must complete within a reasonable time. If a check doesn't complete or gets hung, the next check execution will be delayed. Use proper time outs. Checks must respect the provided context. Specifically, a check must abort its execution, and return an error, if the context has been cancelled.\n\n**A health-check name must be a metric name compatible \""

Analyze the following README content and extract ONLY 10 COMPLETE single or a maximum of two-word high-impact keywords based on the instructions: \"gocraft/health allows you to instrument your service for logging and metrics, and then send that instrumentation to log files, StatsD, Bugsnag, or to be polled and aggregated via a JSON API.\n\ngocraft/health also ships with a New Relic-like aggregator (called healthd) that shows you your slowest endpoints, top error producers, top throughput endpoints, and so on.\n\nFirst, you'll want to make a new Stream and attach your sinks to it. Streams are commonly saved in a global variable.\n\ngocraft/health excels at instrumenting services that perform jobs. Examples of jobs: serving an HTTP request, serving an RPC request, or processing a message from a work queue. Jobs are encoded semantically into gocraft/health in order to provide out-of-the-box answers to questions like, \"what is my slowest endpoint?\"\n\nJobs serve three functions:\nJob record a timing (eg, it took 21ms to complete this job)\nJob record a status (eg, did the job complete successfully or was there an error?)\nJob group instrumentation inside that job together so that you can analyze it later.\n\nLet's say you're writing a web service that processes JSON requests/responses. You might write something like this:\n\n(This example is just used for illustration -in practice, you'll probably want to use middleware to create your job if you have more than a few endpoints.)\n\nThere are five types of completion statuses:\nSuccess: Your job completed successfully.\nError: Some library call resulted in an error that prevented you from successfully completing your job.\nPanic: Some code paniced!\nValidationError: Your code was fine, but the user passed in bad inputs, and so the job wasn't completed successfully.\nJunk: The job wasn't completed successfully, but not really because of an Error or ValidationError. For instance, maybe there's just a 404 (not found) or 401 (unauthorized) request to your app. This status code might not apply to all apps.\n\nWithin jobs, you can emit events, timings, gauges, and errors. The first argument of each of these methods is supposed to be a key. Camel case with dots is good because it works with other metrics stores like StatsD. Each method has a basic version as well as a version that accepts keys/values.\n\nFor the WriterSink, an event is just like logging to a file:\n\nFor the StatsD sink (and other metrics sinks), an event is like incrementing a counter.\n\nNOTE: All timing values are in nanoseconds.\nFor the WriterSink, a timing is just like logging to a file:\n\nFor the StatsD sink, we'll send it to StatsD as a timing.\nThe JSON polling sink will compute a summary of your timings: min, max, avg, stddev, count, sum.\n\nFor the WriterSink, a timing is just like logging to a file:\n\nFor the StatsD sink, we'll send it to StatsD as a gauge.\n\nFor the WriterSink, and error will just log to the file with the error:\n\nFor metrics sinks, Errors are just like Events\nThe JSON polling sink and healthd will let you see which errors are trending.\nFor the Bugsnag sink, we'll push each error to bugsnag.\n\nErrors will capture a stacktrace by default so that you can diagnose it in things like Bugsnag. If an error is common or not worth sending to something like Bugsnag, you can mute it. This will cause health to not capture a stack trace or send it to bugsnag:\n\nSince error handling is so prevalent in Go code, you'll have situations where multiple functions have the option of logging the same root error. The best practice that we've identified is to just not think about it and log it on every level of the call stack. Keep in mind that gocraft/health will handle this intelligently and only send one error to Bugsnag, have a correct root backtrace, and so on.\n\nMost objects and methods in health work with key/value pairs. Key/value pairs are just maps of \""

The images in there are updated automatically in CI using .\n\nLotti is a tool for self-improvement centered around these core beliefs:\n\nLong-term outcomes in life can be improved by following good routines and establishing good habits, such as healthy sleep, mindfulness and improved self-awareness, healthy eating, enough physical activity and the like. Technology is essential when trying to establish and monitor good habits. Paper-based checklists are undesirable.\nHabits need to be monitored long-term. The 21-day habit theory, stating that it takes three weeks to form a new habit and then subsequently sticking with it automatically is questionable at best, and the only way to ensure that habits identified as important are actually followed is to monitor them.\nAny comprehensive attempt at tracking and monitoring the aforementioned areas of life will result in collecting far more data than anyone should be willing to share with anyone else.\n\nLotti is a tool for improving life via establishing good habits and monitoring their outcome.\nAll collected data stays on your devices. Encrypted and entirely private synchronization between your devices can be set up (instructions will follow).\n\nLotti currently supports recording the following data types:\n\nHabits, which can be defined and tracked. Habit tracking then involves recording daily completions, which can be successes, failures, and also skipping the completion in case a habit could not be completed due to external circumstances.\nHealth-related data which can be imported automatically, such as steps, weight, sleep, blood pressure, resting heart rate, and whatever else can be recorded in Apple Health (or the Android equivalent).\nCustom data types, such as the intake of water, food, alcohol, coffee, but also exercises such as pull-ups, you name (and define) it.\nText journal entries.\nTasks, with different statuses to track their lifecycle: open, groomed, in progress, blocked, on hold, done, rejected.\nAudio recordings, as spoken journal entries, and also audio notes, for example when working on a task and documenting progress and doing a quick brain dump that can be useful when picking up a task again later.\nTime, as in recording time spent on a tasks, and also a related story.\nTags for better organization and discoverability of journal entries.\nStories, a special tag type that is useful for reporting time spent on tasks related to their respective stories.\nPeople, a special tag type with no additional functionality yet, only a different tag color.\n\nExperiment/Intervention lifecycle. The app is already useful for monitoring experiments or interventions but those themselves currently remain implicit. For example, an experiment could be taking Vitamin D and see how that affects health parameters, or have a hypothesis what will happen, and then prove or disprove that, where a dashboard help monitor all relevant parameters. In future versions, the lifecycle of interventions shall be made explicit, by defining them in the first place, and then reviewing and refining them.\nBetter Reporting how time is spent.\nUpfront planning of time budgets.\n\nPlease check out for all the information on the project's history and back-story. You can find the previous version (written in Clojure and ClojureScript) in this repo: .\n\nLotti is private and does not share any information with anyone see the .\nLotti is open-source and everyone is encouraged to contribute, be it via contributing to code, providing feedback, testing, identifying bugs, etc.\nLotti strives to be as inclusive as possible and any request for improved accessibility will be addressed.\nLotti is supposed to become a friendly and welcoming community of people who are interested in data, improving their lives, and not or only very selectively sharing their data in the process. Please head over to and say Hi.\nLocalization. Lotti is multilingual and should be available in as many different languages as possible. English is the primary language, and there are French, German, and Romanian translations. Those need some update love, as the are many new UI labels that didn't exist when translations were last looked at. Please help, and also create and PRs for languages you would like to see. Thanks!\n\nLotti is currently available for beta testing for these platforms:\n\niOS and macOS versions are available via a .\nDevelopment is primarily done on macOS and both the iOS and macOS versions are in constant use by the author. You can expect Lotti to work on these two platforms.\nAndroid app is available as both `aab` and `apk` files on .\nBoth appeared to be working fine in some limited testing on both an Android phone and an Android tablet.\nWindows there's an installer named `lotti.msix` in .\nThat's not signed though. There's also a (currently hidden) release on the Microsoft Store which appears to be working fine on Windows. However, some issues in the Microsoft Partner Center need to be resolved before making Lotti available on the Microsoft Store.\nLinux: the simplest way to release would be on the , with automatic updates, but that's blocked by this .\nThere's a file named `linux.x64.tar.gz` that contains the app. From limited testing, the app works fine on Linux, but is missing an app icon (could be a nice small PR).\n\nThe goal is to get Lotti out on all app stores in 2023. Install Flutter, see . Clone repository and go to `./lotti`. Run `flutter pub get`. Run `make watch` or `make build_runner` for code generation. Open in your favorite IDE, e.g. . Run, either from the IDE or using e.g. `flutter run -d macos`\n\nLotti uses for developing and documenting widgets, for now only for select widgets. To run the widgetbook, run e.g. `fvm flutter run -d macos -t lib/widgetbook.dart`.\n\nTested on `macOS 13.3`: no additional steps necessary. You only need to have Xcode installed.\n\nTested on `Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS` inside a virtual machine on VMWare Fusion In addition to the common steps above, install missing dependencies:\n\nIn case the network in the virtual machine is not connecting after resuming: `$ sudo dhclient ens33`\n\nIf your system is set up to run the Flutter counter example app, you should be good to go.\n\nThis project uses for releasing to TestFlight on iOS and macOS, and GitHub Actions for publishing to GitHub Releases for all other platforms.\n\nContributions to this project are very welcome. How can you help?\n\nPlease check under issues if there is anything specific that needs helping hands, or features to be discussed or implemented.\nImprove the test coverage (currently at around 71%). Any additional tests are welcome, including code changes to make the code easier to test.\nCreate issues for feedback and ideas.\nHelp translate into more languages, and improve the existing translations.\n\nThanks!\""

For instance you could make a container unhealthy after a certain amount of requests, or if the queue is too long and even slow requests, and that's what this script tries to achieve!\n\nGood news is that you can still do it even using the mixed container approach, but I wanted to take a time to explain why I came to do it like this now! The advantage in my opinion is that having separate containers you have a better grasp on where the problem is laying and you can restart only what's failing, not the whole, also avoiding Supervisord to restart it for you since you are already behind a container orchestration tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn you php-fpm pool configuration add: pm.status_path = /status\n\nFor instance on the official php image you can alter the file /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/zz-docker.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script is POSIX sh but also uses some tools from your operating system, being:\n\ncgi-fcgi\nsed\ntail\ngrep\n\nIn case you're using alpine you only need to make sure you have installed busybox and fcgi packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can always of course manually edit and maintain the file, as long as you follow the \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're aiming only to make sure php-fpm is alive and answering to requests you can:\n\n\n\nOr with verbose to see php-fpm status output:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you want to fail our healthcheck after your fpm has handled more than 3000 requests:\n\n\n\nAnd you can also check if you have more than 10 processes in the queue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can simply specify FCGI_CONNECT variable with your connection uri:\n\n\n\n\n\nSince v0.5.0\n\nWhile the default status page path is /status, you can replace it in your php-fpm configuration, in order to change also in the script in you can specify FCGI_STATUS_PATH env var within your connection uri:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use HEALTHCHECK command on Dockerfile to define the health of your container. According to , possible return values are 0 for success, 1 to unhealthy and 2 is reserved and we **must not*use this exit code.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore and more people are looking for health checks on kubernetes for php-fpm, here is an example of livenessProbe and readinessProbe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker HEALTHCHECK command is ignored on Kubernetes and you must define it using pod specifications.\n\n\n\nMost of the containers contain limited software installed, using POSIX sh aims to be compatible with most of the OS images around.\n\n\n\nMade with love by \n\nDistributed under\""

Exitmap modules implement tasks that are run over (a subset of) all exit relays.  If you have a background in functional programming, think of exitmap as a map() interface for Tor exit relays: Modules can perform any TCP-based networking task like fetching a web page, uploading a file, connecting to an SSH server, or joining an IRC channel.\n\nIn practice, exitmap is useful to monitor the reliability and trustworthiness of exit relays.  The Tor Project uses exitmap to check for false negatives on the Tor Project's service and to find.  It is easy to develop new modules for exitmap; just have a look at the file HACKING in the doc/ directory or check out one of the existing modules.\n\nExitmap uses Stem to create circuits to all given exit relays.  Each time tor notifies exitmap of an established circuit, a module is invoked for the newly established circuit.  Modules can be pure Python scripts or executables.  For executables, Stem is necessary.\n\nFinally, note that exitmap is a network measurement tool and of little use to ordinary Tor users.  The Tor Project is already running the tool regularly.  More exitmap scans just cause unnecessary network load.  The only reason exitmap is publicly available is because its source code and design might be of interest to some.\n\nInstallation\nExitmap uses the library Stem to communicate with Tor.  There are several ways to install Stem.  The easiest might be to use pip in combination with the provided requirements.txt file:\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nRunning exitmap\nThe only argument exitmap requires is the name of a module.  For example, you can run exitmap with the checktest module by running:\n\n    $ ./bin/exitmap checktest\n\nThe command line output will then show you how Tor bootstraps, the output of the checktest module, and a scan summary.  If you don't need three hops and prefer to use two hops with a static first hop, run:\n\n    $ ./bin/exitmap --first-hop 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 checktest\n\nTo run the same test over German exit relays only, execute:\n\n    $ ./bin/exitmap --country DE --first-hop 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 checktest\n\nIf you want to pause for five seconds in between circuit creations to reduce the load on the Tor network and the scanning destination, run:\n\n    $ ./bin/exitmap --build-delay 5 checktest\n\nNote that `1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678` is a pseudo fingerprint that you should replace with an exit relay that you control.\n\nTo learn more about all of exitmap's options, run:\n\n    $ ./bin/exitmap --help\n\nExitmap comes with batteries included, providing the following modules:\n\ntestfds: Tests if an exit relay is able to fetch the content of a simple web page.  If an exit relay is unable to do that, it might not have enough file descriptors available.\nchecktest: Attempts to find false negatives in the Tor Project's service.\ndnspoison: Attempts to resolve several domains and compares the received DNS A records to the expected records.\ndnssec: Detects exit relays whose resolver does not validate DNSSEC.\npatchingCheck: Checks for file tampering.\ncloudflared: Checks if a web site returns a CloudFlare CAPTCHA.\nrtt: Measure round-trip times through an exit to various destinations.\n\nConfiguration\nBy default, exitmap tries to read the file .exitmaprc in your home directory.  The file accepts all command line options, but you have to replace minuses with underscores.  Here is an example:\n\n    [Defaults]\n    first_hop = 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678\n    verbosity = debug\n    build_delay = 1\n    analysis_dir = /path/to/exitmap_scans\n\nAlternatives\nDon't like exitmap?  Then have a look at, , , , or .\nTests\nBefore submitting pull requests, please make sure that all unit tests pass by running:\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    $ py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov-config .coveragerc --cov=src test\n\nFeedback\nContact: Philipp Winter <phw@nymity.ch>  \nOpenPGP fingerprint: `B369 E7A2 18FE CEAD EB96  8C73 CF70 89E3 D7FD C0D0`\""

It also implements a synchronization client for synchronizing data with the fitbit website on platforms not supported by Fitbit currently.\n\nThe main goal of the library is to augment the services already provided by the fitbit website, allowing for developers to make interesting new applications that access the fitbit data in smaller time chunks on the local machine, as well as giving users the ability to back up their own data without having to rely on the web service.\n\nCurrently, the library only implements a proof of concept of the protocol and web interface in python. This will be turned into a C library, which can then be SWIG'd or otherwise interfaced to other languages.\n\nThe fitbit reverse engineering document in the doc directory may also be used for implementing the protocol in new languages without having to read code (not that my ability to convey the protocol in english is all that clear).\n\nPackage Information\n------------------Source repo @\n\nPlatform Support\n---------------Linux Tested on Ubuntu 10.10\nOS X Untested, should work?\nWindows Won't work at the moment.

You can find out more about DCGM by visiting DCGM's official page\n\nNVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) is a suite of tools for managing and monitoring NVIDIA datacenter GPUs in cluster environments. It includes active health monitoring, comprehensive diagnostics, system alerts and governance policies including power and clock management. It can be used standalone by infrastructure teams and easily integrates into cluster management tools, resource scheduling and monitoring products from NVIDIA partners.\n\nDCGM simplifies GPU administration in the data center, improves resource reliability and uptime, automates administrative tasks, and helps drive overall infrastructure efficiency. DCGM supports Linux operating systems on x86_64, Arm and POWER (ppc64le) platforms. The installer packages include libraries, binaries, NVIDIA Validation Suite (NVVS) and source examples for using the API (C, Python and Go).\n\nDCGM integrates into the Kubernetes ecosystem by allowing users to gather GPU telemetry using .\n\nMore information is available on \n\nDCGM installer packages are available on the CUDA network repository and DCGM can be easily installed using Linux package managers. \n\nSet up the CUDA network repository meta-data, GPG key:Install DCGMSet up the CUDA network repository meta-data, GPG key:Install DCGMFor information on platform support, getting started and using DCGM APIs, visit the official documentation .\n\nOnce this repo is cloned, DCGM can be built by:\n\ncreating the build image\nusing the build image to generate a DCGM build\n\nThe Docker build image provides two benefits\n\neasier builds as the environment is controlled\na repeatable environment which creates reproducible builds\n\nNew dependencies can be added by adding a script in the “scripts” directory\nsimilar to the existing scripts.\n\nAs DCGM needs to support some older Linux distributions on various CPU\narchitectures, the image provide custom builds of GCC compilers that produce\nbinaries which depend on older versions of the GLibc libraries. The DCGM build\nimage will also contain all 3rd party libraries that are precompiled using those\ncustom GCC builds.\n\nIn order to create the build image and to then generate a DCGM build, you will\nneed to have the following installed and configured:\n\ngit and git-lfs (can be skipped if downloading a snapshot archive)\nrealpath, basename, nproc (coreutils deb package)\ngawk (via awk binary, may not work on MacOS without installing a gawk port)\ngetopt (util-linux deb package)\nrecent version of Docker\n\nThe build.sh script was tested in Linux, Windows (WSL2) and MacOS, though MacOS\nmay need some minor changes in the script (like `s/awk/gawk/`) as MacOS is not an\nofficially supported development environment.\n\nThe build image is stored in ./dcgmbuild.\n\nThe image can be built by:\n\nensuring Docker is installed and running\nnavigating to ./dcgmbuild\nrunning ./build.sh\n\nNote that if your user does not have permission to access the Docker socket, you\nwill need to run sudo ./build.sh\n\nThe build process may take several hours to create the image as the image is\nbuilding 3 versions of GCC toolset for all supported platforms. Once the image\nhas been built, it can be reused to build DCGM.\n\nOnce the build image is created, you can use the run build.sh to produce builds. A simple debian build of release (non-debug) code for an x86_64 system can be made with: \n\n./build.sh -r --deb\n\nThe rpm will be placed in _out/Linux-amd64-release/datacenter-gpu-manager_2.1.4_amd64.deb; it can now be installed as needed. The script includes options for building just the binaries (default), tarballs (--packages), or RPM (--rpm) as well. A complete list of options can been seen using ./build.sh -h.\n\nDCGM includes an extensive test suite that can be run on any system with one or more supported GPUs. After successfully building DCGM, a datacenter-gpu-manager-tests package is created alongside the normal DCGM package. There are multiple ways to run the tests but the most straightforward steps are the following:\nInstall or extract the datacenter-gpu-manager-tests package\nNavigate to usr/share/dcgm_tests\nExecute run_tests.sh\n\nNotes:\nThe location of the tests depends on the type of DCGM package. If the installed package was a .deb or .rpm file then the location is /usr/share/dcgm_tests. If the package was .tar.gz then the location is relative to where it was uncompresssed.\nThe test suite utilizes DCGM's python bindings. Python version 2 is the only supported version at this time.\nRunning the tests as root is not required. However, some tests that require root permissions will not execute. For maximum test coverage running the tests as root is recommended.\nThe entire test suite can take anywhere from 10 to >60 minutes depending on the speed of the machine, the number of gpus and the presence of additional NVIDIA hardware such as NVSwitches and NVLinks.

There are no dependencies to the existing . This wsgi application talks to the cluster directly via librados.\n\nYou can find a blog entry regarding monitoring a Ceph cluster with ceph-dash on .\n\n you can find a presentation from Paul Evans, taken from the Ceph Day in San Francisco (March 12, 2015) where he is comparing several Ceph-GUIs, including ceph-dash.\n\nNewest Feature\n-------------\nI recently played around with  on . This was so far my fastest Ceph cluster to setup. Since Rook provides some secrets and config maps already, I made the docker container for Ceph-dash compatible with their format. I also added Kubernetes deployment files in the contrib folder (tested on , but should work on any Kubernetes cluster). No need to configure anything, they should just work out of the box.\n\n\n\nSince everybody recently seems to be hyped as hell about the container stuff, I've decided that I can contribute to that with a ready-to-use docker container. Available at  you can pull the ceph-dash container and configure it via the following environment variables:\n\nRequired: $CEPHMONS (comma separated list of ceph monitor ip addresses)\nRequired: $KEYRING (full keyring that you want to use to connect to your ceph cluster)\nOptional: $NAME (name of the key you want to use)\nOptional: $ID (id of the key you want to use)\n\n**Example*I've refactored the code quite a bit to make use of  instead of . The structure of the code has changed, but I was keeping everything backwards compatible to all your deployments should still work with the current version. This is for now not a release, because I want to see if there is some negative feedback on this. And here are two new things you can cheer about!\n\n\n\nYour browser does not talk directly to  directly anymore! It uses the  endpoint which already provides flot-formated json output. Ceph-dash will establish a connection to Graphite and gather all relevant data. This should prevent Cross-Domain issues and in case of , also hides the database password. Due to it's generic nature, it should be easy to add more graphing backends if needed.\n\n\n\nCeph-dash now supports also  as a graphing backend besides . You need client and server version  since the api broke with that release and is not backwards compatible. If you do not have the InfluxDB python module installed, Ceph-dash will *NOTenable the InfluxDB proxy and will not load any configured InfluxDB resources. So please be sure to have the latest InfluxDB python module installed if you want to use InfluxDB as a backend.\nYou can find a sample configuration file called  in the root folder, which should explain how to use it. Please understand that I can't give you support for you InfluxDB setup, because this would definitely exceed the scope of Ceph-Dash.\n\n\n\nIf an AJAX call to the underlying ceph-dash API isn't answered within 3 seconds, a silent timeout is happening. The dashboard will still show the old data. I wanted to give the user a hint if something is wrong with the api or the ceph cluster, so I've added a little warning icon that tells you if the data shown in ceph-dash is getting to old. Reasons for that can be an slow or unresponsive cluster (some error handling is happening a monitor failover for example).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current release features a popover, which becomes available if there are any unhealthy osds in the cluster. If the count for Unhealthy osds is not 0, hovering over the field with the number of unhealthy osds will show a popover with additional information about those osds (including the name, the state and the host that contains this osd). To do this, ceph-dash has to issue an additional command to the cluster. This additional request will only be triggered if the first command shows any unhealthy osds!\n\n\n\nI also did some minor code refactoring to clean everything up a bit.\n\nQuickstart\n---------clone this repository\nplace it on one of your ceph monitor nodes\nrun \npoint your browser to http://ceph-monitor:5000/\nenjoy!\n\nDashboard\n--------If you hit the address via a browser, you see the web frontend, that will inform you on a single page about all important things of your ceph cluster.\n\nREST Api\n-------If you access the address via commandline tools or programming languages, use  and you will get all the information as a json output (which is actually the json formatted output of ).\n\nAnyways, this is not a wrapper around the ceph binary, it uses the python bindings of librados.\n\nThis api can be requested by, for example, a nagios check, to check your overall cluster health. This brings the advantage of querying this information without running local checks on your monitor nodes, just by accessing a read only http api.\n\nNagios Check\n-----------A Nagios check that uses ceph-dash for monitoring your ceph cluster status is available \n\nDeployment\n---------You may want to deploy this wsgi application into a real webserver like apache or nginx. For convenience, I've put the wsgi file and a sample apache vhost config inside of the  folder,\n\nYou can edit the config.json file to configure how to talk to the Ceph cluster.\n\n `ceph_config` is the location of /etc/ceph/ceph.conf\n `keyring` points to a keyring to use to authenticate with the cluster\n `client_id` or `client_name` is used to specify the name to use with the keyring\n\nPictures!!\n---------\nIn case anyone wants to see what to expect, here you go:\n\n\n\nGraphite Integration\n-------------------I've integrated the flot graphing library to make it possible to show some graphs from  in ceph-dash. First of all: ceph-dash does **NOT*put any data into graphite! You have to do it yourself. We are using our  monitoring to push performance metrics to graphite. The graphs shown in the example were created by the above mentioned .\n\nIf you do not have a graphite section in your  the Metrics section will not appear in ceph-dash.\n\n\n\nThere is a sample configuration file called . Everything in there should be quite self-explanatory. If not, feel free to open an issue on github!\n\n\n\nHere you can see an example where one graph shows the bytes read/write per second, and another one shows the IOPS during the last two hours:\n\n\n\nFAQ\n--The development server of Ceph-dash runs by default on port If you can't use this port since it is already used by another application, you can change it by opening `ceph-dash.py` and change the line\n\nto\n\nPlease keep in mind that the development server should not be used in a production environment. Ceph-dash should be deployed into a proper webserver like Apache or Nginx.\n\n\n\nSince Version 1.2 ceph-dash is able to run behind a reverse proxy that rewrites the path where ceph-dash resides correctly. If you are using nginx, you need to use a config like this:\n\n\n\nSee also: https://github.com/wilbertom/flask-reverse-proxy, which is where I got the code for doing this.\n\n\n\nSee  for a detailed explanation how to fix errors with NginX and uwsgi (Thanks to )\""

Aus Sicherheitsgründen haben diese Zertifikate ein Verfallsdatum. Daher müssen sie regelmäßig erneut werden. Nicht alle Hersteller haben einen Mechanismus zur Verlängerung der Zertifikate implementiert. Nach Auslaufen der Zertifikate muss also der gesamte Konnektor getauscht werden. Derzeit laufen die ersten Zertifikate aus.\n\nVerantwortlich für die TI ist die gematik. Deren Gesellschafter, diese Konnektoren auszutauschen. Das erzeugt Kosten im Bereich vom 300 bis 400 Millionen Euro.\n\nWir zeigen hier eine kostenlose Softwarelösung für das Problem, von der die Hersteller behaupten, dass sie unmöglich sei.\n\nUnser Patch klinkt sich in die Kommunikation zwischen der Software auf dem Konnektor und der Smartcard ein. Das geht, weil die Kommunikation zur Smartcard nicht abgesichert ist. Unter anderem deshalb war auch der im SecunetAdapter möglich.\n\n> **Wichtig**: Unser Patch stellt keinen Angriff auf die Integrität des Konnektors dar. Zwar klinkt sich der Patch in die Kommunikation zur Smartcard ein, es werden aber nur öffentliche, also nicht geheime Daten verändert. Die privaten Schlüssel verbleiben unverändert auf der besonders abgesicherten Smartcard.\n\nSowohl bei dem Produkt der Secunet als auch bei der CompuGroup Medical kommt die Software PC/SC Smart Card Daemon zur Kommunikation mit den SmartCards zum Einsatz. Diese Software öffnet einen Socket (z. B. in /var/run/pcscd.comm), über den Anwendungen mit dem `pcscd` interagieren, um der Smartcard Befehle zu senden und Antworten von dieser zu empfangen.\n\nUnsere Referenzimplementierung für die Verlängerung der Zertifikatslaufzeiten besteht darin, an der Stelle des ursprünglichen `pcscd` eine modifizierte Version zu starten, die alle Befehle an die SmartCard wie gewohnt weiterleitet. Wird jedoch der Befehl zum Auslesen eines der drei vom Auslaufen betroffenen Zertifikate gesendet, antwortet unser `pcscd` mit einem verlängerten Zertifikat aus dem Dateisystem.\n\nDadurch sind keine Veränderungen an der bestehenden Software der Hersteller notwendig. Es muss lediglich eine Teilkomponente des Linux-Systems, auf dem die Hersteller ihre TI Konnektoren basiert haben, umkonfiguriert bzw. ausgetauscht werden.\n\nWir verwenden einen handelsüblichen PC/SC Smart Card Daemon und simulieren diesem SmartCards mithilfe des Projekts `virtualsmartcard`.\n\nAuf dem Konnektor bleibt der bestehende `pcscd` des Herstellers im Hintergrund aktiv, sein Socket wird aber an einen neuen Ort im Dateisystem verschoben: `mv /var/run/pcscd.comm /var/run/old_pcscd.comm`. Dann wird ein handelsüblicher `pcscd` sowie `virtualsmartcard` installiert und gestartet. Wichtig ist, dass der `pcscd` so konfiguriert wird, lediglich die Treiber für `virtualsmartcard` zu laden.\n\nIn dem Verzeichnis `./certs` sind die verlängerten Zertifikate mit folgenden Dateinamen zu hinterlegen:\n    `AK_AUT.der`\n    `NK_VPN.der`\n    `SAK_AUT.der`\n\nZuletzt muss das Python-Skript `./save_400m_euro.py` aus diesem Projekt gestartet werden. Dieses verfolgt in der `execute()` Methode alle APDUs und prüft, ob ein Zugriff auf die Zertifikatsdateien erfolgt.\n\nDie Hersteller müssen dieses Skript in eine Update-Datei verpacken, diese signieren und bereitstellen, denn schließlich darf nur Software vom Hersteller auf dem Konnektor ausgeführt werden.\n\nFür die Verlängerung der Zertifikatslaufzeiten braucht es die gematik, denn sie verantwortet und betreibt die dazu notwendige Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nWir fordern die gematik auf, ihre CA für die Verlängerung der Laufzeiten einzusetzen. Wir fordern alle Hersteller auf, die Laufzeitverlängerung umzusetzen, statt das Gesundheitssystem durch die aufgerufenen astronomischen Preise auszubeuten. Wir fordern das Bundesgesundheitsministerium auf, die Hersteller endlich an die Leine zu nehmen und der Geldverbrennung in der TI ein Ende zu setzen. Wir fordern das Umweltministerium auf, die allein schon aus Nachhaltigkeitsgesichtspunkten völlig sinnlose tausendfache Vernichtung einsatzfähiger Hardware zu verhindern.\""

In this report, I want to highlight some of the most important stories related to machine learning and NLP that I came across in I will mostly focus on NLP but I will also highlight a few interesting stories related to AI in general. The headlines are in no particular order. Stories may include publications, engineering efforts, yearly reports, the release of educational resources, etc.\n\nIt has been a big year for the field of natural language processing (NLP) and for machine learning as a whole. There have been many trends and breaking stories, with state-of-the-art results and new interesting research directions emerging. We owe all of this progress to the brilliant researchers around the world and the millions of developers devoting their full time to improve tools that make it easier for everyone to learn and progress the field. We have witnessed a rise in transfer learning and other niche areas of research such as AI Ethics.\n\nIn this report, I have provided a summary of all the biggest NLP stories of the year (2018) coming from both academia and the industry. I hope this report serves as a guide for the researcher and developer that wishes to start learning about this field and also for the expert who wishes to brush up on some of the latest advancements. The selected topics are based purely on personal observation, so it is highly possible that I missed other important stories. In fact, the stories shared here are an extended compilation of the NLP Newsletter published weekly on the publication. I have made an effort to categorize the stories in the best possible way so that the report could benefit as many readers as possible. Please note that the report is meant to be non-technical for the purpose of reaching as many diverse readers as possible. The stories are mainly categorized by the following key topics: AI ethics, research publications, trends, education, resources, industry, and much more.\n\nIf you are interested in extending this report for the upcoming year (2020), get in touch with me through Twitter () or at ellfae@gmail.com.\n\nIf you use this report as reference, please cite:\""

The project has therefore been frozen. This repository will be placed into archival mode and will remain available for the foreseeable future, however it will no longer be actively maintained.\n\n\nThis repository contains a proposal for encoding and signing the Electronic Health Certificate (HCERT), as a candidate to be adapted and adopted by eHealth authorities and other stakeholders as they see fit.\n\n\nThe current authoritative version is tagged as .\n\n\nThe following requirements and principles have been used when designing the Electronic Health Certificate (HCERT):\n\n* Electronic Health Certificates shall be carried by the holder and must have the ability to be securely validated off-line (using strong and proven cryptographic primitives).\n\n  *Example: Signed data with machine readable content. Use an encoding which is as compact as practically possible whilst ensuring reliable decoding using optical means.\n  *Example: CBOR in combination with deflate compression and QR encoding. Use existing, proven and modern open standards, with running code available (when possible) for all common platforms and operating environments to limit implementation efforts and minimise risk of interoperability issues.\n  *Example: CBOR Web Tokens (CWT). When existing standards do not exist, define and test new mechanisms based on existing mechanisms and ensure running code exists.\n  *Example: Base45 encoding per new Internet Draft. Ensure compatibility with existing systems for optical decoding.\n  *Example: Base45 encoding for optical transport. The trust model is based on the ICAO Master List concept with some minor modifications to improve performance and compatibility. At the center of the model is the  and the associated . The gateway operates in a B2B model with onboarded countries. Member States are then responsible for publishing their own trust lists publicly on their own national backends.\n\n\nAt its core the trust model consists of a simple, one layer deep list of Country Signing Certificate Authorities (CSCA) that sign Document Signer Certificates (DSC). These are then used to sign the aforementioned digital health certificates (HCERT).\n\n\nThe trusted keys which will be used by verifiers are published in a list which includes all public keys together with issuer metadata. The keys which from time to time are used to sign the HCERTs and should be trusted are included on the Trusted List. There are no CAs or other intermediate parties involved in the validation process in the verifier. If a CSCA'ss public keys appear in the list, they are _only_ there to facilitate the creation of the trusted list of public keys itself. They are not used during verification of an HCERT (as this is generally offline and purely based on the trusted list of that day).\n\n\nRevocation is implemented via omission. The Trusted List contains all valid certificates, so revocation is achieved by removing a certificate from the Trusted List.\n\n\nMultiple implementations are available via the  GitHub repository.\n\n\nHighly simplified JSON/CBOR/COSE/Zlib/Base45 pipelines:\n\nQr and Aztec code have a specific, highly efficient, method for storing alphanumeric characters (MODE 2/0010).

The State of Health Tracking app offers an all-encompassing solution for tracking your macros and workouts.\n\nAt State of Health, we strive to simplify fitness. Our app is devoid of unnecessary features and is exceptionally user-friendly. It includes progressive overload tracking to ensure you add more reps or weight with each workout. Moreover, our app is seamlessly integrated with the USDA food database, enabling you to easily search for nearly any food item containing a label within the United States.\n\nOur tracking app is loaded with comprehensive graphs, and charts to make sure you are on track every day to hit your goals. Each day you log a workout or meal, a diary entry will automatically be created for you to keep track of your progress.\n\n\n\nThis app assumes you are using Expo EAS and have a registered Apple Developer account.\n\n\nTo setup use with firebase:\nCreate an iOS app in the Firebase console.\nGenerate GoogleService-Info.plist file from Firebase.\nGenerate an OAuth 2.0 Token and add to the GoogleServices-Info.plist file: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2\nAdd GoogleService-Info.plist to root dir of project.\n\n\ncopy `.env.dist` and paste it as `.env`\nGenerate API Key for USDA API here: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html or request key from project maintainer.\nUpdate `USDA_FOOD_API_KEY=` in the .env file with your API Key.\n\n\nEAS builds will ignore files found in .gitignore. Because of this, you must remove `.GoogleService-Info.plist` from the .gitignore to upload a build with EAS. Failing to do so will result in a failed build.\n\n\n\nRun an iOS dev build on a simulator:\nMake sure all node modules are installed `npm i`\nOpen a simulator from XCode.\nRun `npm run ios`\n\nRun an iOS dev build on a physical device:\nCreate a native build in EAS. Run `npm run build-ios-dev` to upload a dev build to EAS.\nRun Expo `npm run start`\n\nTo debug crashlytics on a dev build, add a firebase.json file with the following to the root dir of the project:\n\n\n\nMake sure to increment `version` and `buildNumber` inside the app.json file.\nBuild a native iOS build with `npx expo run:ios`\nCreate an iOS Prod build via `eas build --platform ios`.

Please note that the `shrek` module is called a *facademodule following the ) and there can only be one *facademodule per service.\n\nMake sure you have the Marine tools  and compile the `donkey` and `shrek`, respectively, which we can do with the `build.sh` script:\n\nwhich creates two independent Wasm modules that are placed in the `artifacts` directory:\n\nNow that we have our modules, we can explore them with the Marine REPL. Note that we use the  `Config.toml` file to help out the REPL by providing the module location and names. Once we got the REPL up and running, we can interact with both modules and, as expected, the `shrek` module is successfully able to access the `donkey` module's exposed functions.\n\nLooks like everything is in order and the modules are ready for  and .\n\nDo not forget to check our .\n\n: a generator of IT\n    : a handy structure for interface types handling\n    : a crate for conversion between IT and JSON\n    keeps minimal supported versions of IT and SDK by runtime\n    : a parser of the module manifest and the SDK version\n    : a parser of module IT\n    : some utility functions and consts\n: several Marine examples used mostly for tests\n: a Fluence FaaS layer that provides host closures, IT<->JSON conversion, logger, config handling and other things\n: a Fluence Application Service layer that provides basic API for service running\n: a runtime layer that provides basic functionality for loading, unloading and calling modules\n: a web runtime layer aimed to run Marine in a browser\n: a REPL intended to test Marine Wasm modules\n    : a CLI intended to build and extract some info from Marine Wasm modules\n\nPlease,  if you find a bug.

The ESP32 can be controlled using an Android App that is connected via Bluetooth. Another Goal i wanted to achieve is the possibility to do \"Wardriving\" for Sub-Ghz Signals. I accomplished this by using the GPS Location of my Android Device paired with a recorded Signal from the ESP32 and storing Signaldata, Date, Time and the Location where it was received in a local Database.\n\n**NOTE:** This Project is in a very early State. Contribution by anyone is Welcome.\n\nSince the Flipper Zero also utilizes a CC1101 Transceiver for Sub-Ghz Operations i wanted to make use of the large amount of recorded .sub Files that are provided by the Community.\nWith this Setup it is possible to transmit .sub Files that were recorded using a Flipper Zero Device. You can download those Files to your Phone and Import them within the SubMarine Android App.\nOnce you did that, you are able to transmit the Signal or even store it in your local Database for later use.\nCurrently the Implementation requires the following the Properties in the .sub File:\n\n| Property | Value |\n| -----| -----|\n| Filetype | Flipper SubGhz RAW File |\n| Preset | FuriHalSubGhzPresetOok650Async or FuriHalSubGhzPresetOok270Async |\n| Protocol | RAW |\n\nMore supported Properties will be implemented in the Future, however those Properties are set in most of the public available .sub Files already.\n\nThe Device can record raw Signals and save them in a local Database.\n\nRecorded Signals can be replayed immediately after recording or anytime after they were stored in the Database.\n\nThe Device can scan a list of Frquencys in a row quickly and indicate if a transmission is received on one of those.\n\nFrequency, Modulation, DRate, RxBandwith and PktFormat of the CC1101 can be changed while the Device is connected.\n\nWhen the Periscope Mode is activated the Device records any received Signal and sends it to the connected Android Device. On the Android Device the Signaldata is extended with the current GPS Location, Date and Time and then stored in the local Database so it can be replayed later.\n\nYou can browse, search and edit your recorded Signals anytime without being connected to the ESPThe Signalgenerator lets you play around with recorded Signals. You can set a Symbolrate and view Binary and Hex Data of recorded Signals.

Documentation is available at https://ais-dotnet.github.io/Ais.Net/\n\nThis library has been developed to support specific applications, so it only supports message types that have been needed to date in those applications. The following message types are currently supported.\n\n| ID(s)   | Name                                |\n|---------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1, 2, 3 | Position Report Class A             |\n| 5       | Static Voyage Related Data          |\n| 18      | Standard Class B CS Position Report |\n| 19      | Extended Class B CS Position Report |\n| 24      | Static Data Report                  |\n| 27      | Long Range AIS Broadcast message    |\n\nSee https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html for a complete list of message types.\n\nThe benchmark suite is a work in progress, but it currently measures two basic scenarios: discovering message types, and extracting position data. Here are the results of executing these benchmarks on a system with an Intel Core i9-9900K CPU 3.60GHz CPU:\n\nThe test processes 1 million messages, so to get the per-message timings, we divide by 1 million (so `ms` in this table indicate ns per message). This demonstrates a per-message cost of 404ns to extract the position data, or 348ns just to inspect the message type. Note that these tests read data from a file, so this includes all the IO overhead involved in getting hold of the data to be processed. (These messages are in NMEA format by the way.)\n\nNote that the `1000.0000` Gen 0 GCs is slightly misleading. BenchmarkDotNet reports the number of GCs per 1,000 executions of the benchmark. But in this case the benchmarks take long enough that it only executes them once each per iteration. The number it shows is the number of GCs multiplied by 1,000, then divided by the number of times it executed the benchmark (i.e. 1), so what this actually shows is that there was a single GC. We seem to see this whether we parse 1,000, 1,000,000, or 10,000,000 messages, so although we're not quite sure why we get an GC at all, the important point here is that the memory overhead is fixed, no matter how many messages you process.\n\nAis.Net is available under the open source license.

The physics engine is based on the core functionality of the Bullet library, extended to deliver realistic simulation of marine robots. It is directed towards researchers in the field of marine robotics but can as well be used as a general purpose robot simulator.\n\nStonefish includes advanced hydrodynamic computations based on actual geometry of bodies, to better approximate hydrodynamic forces and allow for effects not possible when using symbolic models. The rendering pipeline, developed from the ground up, delivers realistic rendering of atmosphere, ocean and underwater environment. Special focus was put on the latter, where effects of wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering were considered (other simulators often use only blue fog).\n\nStonefish can be used to create standalone applications or combined with a ROS package, which implements standard simulator node and facilitates easy integration with ROS architecture.\n\nThere are two sources of documentation for the library: user manual and code documentation generated with Doxygen, based on comments in the code (instructions below).\n\nThe simulation is CPU heavy and requires a recent GPU. The minimum requirement is the support for OpenGL 4.3.\n\nInstall official manufacturer drivers for your graphics card before using Stonefish!\n\nThe software is developed and tested on Linux Ubuntu. It should work on any Unix based platform. A version for Windows is not available at this time. MacOS is not supported due to its lack of support for OpenGL 4.\n\nDependencies\n- OpenGL Mathematics library (libglm-dev, version >= 0.9.9.0)\n- SDL2 library (libsdl2-dev, may need the following fix!)\n    Install SDL2 library from the repository.\n    `cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/SDL2/`\n    `sudo vim sdl2-config.cmake`\n    Remove space after \"-lSDL2\".\n    Save file.\n- Freetype library (libfreetype6-dev)\n\nBuilding\n- Clone stonefish repository.\n- `cd stonefish`\n- `mkdir build`\n- `cd build`\n- `cmake ..`\n- `make -jX` (where X is the number of threads)\n- `sudo make install`\n\nDocumentation\n- Go to \"stonefish\" directory.\n- `doxygen doxygen`\n- Open \"docs/html/index.html\".\n\nThis software was written and is continuously developed by Patryk Cieślak.

It can be applied in multiple tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, free-space segmentation, and waterline segmentation.\nOur dataset covers diverse time conditions (daytime, nightfall, night), lighting conditions (normal, dim, strong), weather conditions (sunny, overcast, rainy, snowy) and waterway conditions (river, lake, canal, moat). An information list is also offered for retrieving specific data for experiments under different conditions.\nWe provide 2D box-level and pixel-level annotations for camera images, and 3D point-level annotations for radar point clouds. We also offer precise timestamps for the synchronization of different sensors, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.\nWe provide a toolkit for radar point clouds that includes: pre-processing, labeling, projection and visualization, assisting researchers in processing and analyzing our dataset.\n\n![image/USV-setup.png](image/USV-setup.png)\n\n![image/collection.png](image/collection.png)\n\nThe dataset includes 54,120 sets of RGB images, radar point clouds, GPS and IMU data, covering over 200,000 objects.\n\n| Tasks                                                                                      | Object Detection / Instance Segmentation / Semantic Segmentation | Free-Space Segmentation | Waterline Segmentation | Adverse Conditions   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Classes                                                                                      | Total                                                          | Pier                    | Buoy                   | Sailor               | Ship                 | Boat                  | Vessel                | Kayak                | Free-Space           | Waterline            | Lighting             | Weather              |\n| Frames                                                                                       | 54,120                                                         | 25,787                  | 3,769                  | 3,613                | 19,776               | 9,106                 | 9,362                 | 366                  | 54,057               | 53,926               | 5,604                | 10,729               |\n| Objects                                                                                    | 202,807                                                        | 121,827 (60.07%)        | 16,538 (8.15%)           | 8,036 (3.96%)          | 34,121 (16.82%)        | 10,819 (5.33%)        | 11,092 (5.47%)        | 374 (0.18%)            | 54,057               | 159,901              | 30,517 (15.05%)        | 46,784 (23.07%)        |\n\n![image/categories.png](image/categories.png)\n\n| Code | Label      | Note                                               |\n|------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| -1   | no-object  | No object.

Large swaths of marine debris are also navigational hazards to vessels. Artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning, can be used to detect floating marine debris in satellite imagery. In this project, we seek to demonstrate the strong potential of using commercial small satellite imagery for detecting marine debris pollution and strengthening current and future efforts to clean the oceans. We present an application of a deep learning model designed for object detection in the TensorFlow framework for observing marine debris floating on the surface of the ocean. The model was trained on our custom-labeled dataset of 1370 polygons containing marine debris as observed in . An overall precision score of 0.78 and recall score of 0.70 were obtained on the test dataset. \n\nModel performance on test images:\n<img src=\"assets/predictions0.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n<img src=\"assets/predictions1.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n\nPaper and dataset forthcoming. Planet small satellite imagery is utilized in this study. Specifically, the 3-meter imagery product called Planetscope. This imagery has four bands namely red, green, blue, and near-infrared. The combination of fairly high spatial resolution, high temporal resolution, availability of a near-infrared channel and global coverage of coastlines made this imagery quite advantageous for the purposes of this research. With these imagery specifications as well as plastic size and ghost fishing net size categories, we anticipated our model would be capable of detecting aggregated debris flotsam as well as some mega plastics including medium to large size ghost fishing nets.\n\nUsing the Planet Explorer, specific image scenes consisting of visible marine debris patches were selected for our training dataset. This step involved manually exploring Planetscope scenes and verifying the presence of marine debris. For this initial study, we decided to focus our efforts on detecting marine debris from optical (red, green, blue) channel imagery. Initial investigation into the utility of the Planetscope near-infrared channel was conducted, and future work will integrate the near-infrared channel.\n\nWe used  to manually digitize bounding box annotations for observable debris on Planetscope optical imagery. A total of 1370 bounding boxes were labeled on the image scenes. This constituted the initial training, testing and validation dataset for object detection modeling.\n\nThe next task was to prepare the dataset in model-ready format, which entailed tiling the image scenes into smaller frames and encoding the bounding boxes into coordinate arrays with numerical class ids. The need for tiling the imagery stems from computational efficiency at model runtime. To accomplish these tasks, we used . We used zoom level 16 as it most closely approximates the native spatial resolution of Planetscope imagery. An example configuration file for use with LM is located at *data_utils/config.json*. Finally, the dataset in compressed array format (.npz) was used to create binary TensorFlow Records datasets.\n\nTiled image with labels.npz entry. On the right are the bounding box annotation coordinates `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]` and `class ID 1`, with the image array on the bottom:\n<img src=\"assets/tiled_example_npz.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n\nTiled images with plotted annotations:\n<img src=\"assets/tiled_example.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n\nOur architecture of choice for this project is , which we've implemented with the . We employed a weighted sigmoid focal loss and transfer learning for our baseline model from a  hosted on Tensorflow model zoo. Our best model currently performs with a test F1 score of 0. After training is complete, we export the best model to , package the trained model weights and inference code into a  image and deploy at scale through our inference pipeline (shown below).\n\nFor inference, we use the  to request a list of  for a given area of interest and time range. We send that list of tiles via  to our inference endpoint, and once deployed, we can inference at a rate of 3000 tiles of size 256x256 pixels per minute. The results written to the database include, for each XYZ tile, the original Planet image scene ID and XYZ tile name (containing the x coordinate, y coordinate and zoom level) and one or more bounding box coordinates, class values and confidence scores. We use the python utility, , to translate the XYZ coordinates to latitude and longitude coordinates and finally, export the final predictions with a minimum confidence threshold to GeoJSON format. The GeoJSON files are used for display in an online dashboard.\n\nScaled model inference pipeline:\n<img src=\"assets/model_inference.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n\nWe recommend creating a python 3.6virtual environment for this project. You can use  to do so.\n\nInstall these Tensorflow versions in the activated environment.\n\nDownload the necessary scripts with `git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git`\nInstall TensorFlow Object Detection API by strictly following . Once you've successfully run `python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py` you are ready for the next step.\nTo access the necessary utility scripts, you'll need to run all the following commands from the `models/research/object_detection` directory from the cloned repo. **From here on we will refer the TensorFlow Object Detection directory `models/research/object_detection/` as the TOD directory.*You could also work from this  as a stable implementation with the above listed TF library versions. Just ensure that repo folder is set as `models/research/object_detection/`.\n\nTensorflow API supports a variety of file formats. The TFRecord file format is a simple record-oriented binary format that many TensorFlow applications use. We have example code in this repo which converts the `labels.npz` file to a TFRecords file:\n\nCopy  to the TOD directory, .\nYour $folder will be the `data` path containing your `labels.npz` file and `tiles`.\nFrom the TOD directory run:\n\n\nThis will create `train.record`, `val.record` and `test.record` files in a folder called `tf_records` in the TOD directory. Each record file contains different and non-overlapping partitions of the data (86,7,7 percents, respectively).\n\nNow we're ready to set up the model architecture. For this walkthrough, we'll download a pre-trained model from the . We'll demonstrate using  (download link):\n  Download the model, unzip, and move the folder to the TOD directory\n  Create a new folder `training` in the TOD directory.\n  Copy a  to the `training directory`. \n  Copy a  to the `data` directory.\n\nNow your current directory should be `models/research/object_detection/` and in addition to the files included in that repo originally, your folder structure should look like this:\n\n\n\nYou are now ready to train the model. From the `models/research/` directory, run:\n\n\n\nThe model checkpoints and outputs for this task will save in the `training` folder. \n\nUsing this , create the marine debris detection model inference graph with:\n\n\nWe can visualize this graph using :\n\n\n\nGo to `http://127.0.0.1:6006/` in your web browser and you will see:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/tensorboard.png\" width=\"1000\" />\n</p>\n\nNow let's run the model over our test tiles to predict where marine debris patches are. Copy  to the TOD directory then run:\n\n\nThis code will read through all your test images in `path/to/test/image/tiles` folder and output the final prediction into the same folder. You will find new images in `test_image_path` with the `_test` suffixed to the end of the file basenames. The are images with the predicted bounding boxes and confidence scores plotted on top. As well, you will find a multipolygon geojson of predicted bounding boxes in the `test_image_path`. \n\nOption for flags:\n\nDetections geo-registered and vectorized to GeoJSON format:\n<img src=\"assets/detections_geo.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"auto\">\n\nYou can use the  in this folder to compute standard evaluation metrics with your model.

Done as a part of a Master's thesis work.\n\n**_Summer (red) and winter (blue) vessel tracks in the Baltic Sea:_* Notebooks 1-6 will guide how the models are created. AIS observation and dirways from 2017-19 (data/datasets.zip & http://ieee-dataport.org/2099).\n\n- Training set containing 14 million AIS observations from the summer and fall of 2017-18\n- Summer and winter validation sets containing 120 thousand observations from 380 voyages\n- More data such as port locations and sea areas.\n\nMethod for calculating voyages out of AIS data (see EXTRA Voyage Mapping). Method for extracting mooring areas from AIS data (see EXTRA Extract ports from observation data).\n\n> Icebreaking activity and seasonal ice propose challenges for marine traffic prediction in the Baltic Sea. Traffic prediction is a vital part in the planning of icebreaking activities. However, the prediction is still mostly manual. To combat this, the aim of this thesis is to examine factors influencing marine traffic modelling in ice-covered waters and propose a novel A*-based method for modelling traffic in ice. The current state of the marine traffic modelling and factors affecting vessel movement are concluded by examining the literature and historical vessel tracks.\n\n> To summarize the literature review, the field of traffic modelling research is growing and shows great promise. However, the biggest challenges are evaluation of results and the lack of publicly available datasets. Moreover, the current approaches to model vessel movement in ice show promise but they fail to capture how icebreaking activity influences vessel routes.\n\nThe proposed model consists of sea, maneuverability, route, and speed modelling. The model uses historical AIS data, topography of the sea, vessel type, and dirways as main data inputs. The model is trained with summer tracks, and dirways are used for modelling the ice channels kept open by icebreakers. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by examining route, speed, traffic, and ETA (estimated time of arrival) prediction results separately. Moreover, the area between the actual and predicted route is introduced as an accuracy measure for route prediction.\n\nThe model shows that winter route prediction can be improved by incorporating dirways to the modelling. However, the use of dirways did not affect speed, traffic, or ETA prediction accuracy. Finally, the AIS datasets and the source code used in this thesis are published online.\n\n**_Sea model (Notebooks 1-2):_**\n\n**_Manoeuvrability model (Visualized in Notebook 2):_**\n\n**_Route model (Notebook 4):_**\n\n**_Speed model (Notebook 6):_**\n\n**_Transition probability (Notebook 5):_**\n\n**_A shortest path algorithm for route prediction (Notebooks 7-8 and pygradu/shortest_path.py):_**\n\n**_Winter route prediction example:_**\""

PyCO2SYS solves the full marine carbonate system from the values of any two of its parameters.\n\nEvery combination of input parameters has been tested, with differences in the results small enough to be attributable to floating point errors and iterative solver endpoint differences (i.e. negligible). See the scripts in the tests directory to see how and check this for yourself, and their documentation in the online docs. **Please report any discrepancies that we have not spotted as soon as possible!** Documentation is available online at <https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.\n\nThere are also some usage examples that you can either download or run live in your web browser (with no Python installation required) at <https://colab.research.google.com/github/OCOSIT/PyCO2SYS/blob/main/examples.ipynb>.\n\nA paper describing PyCO2SYS is freely available:\n\n> Humphreys, M.

To solve the marine carbonate system from two of its parameters (`par1` and `par2`), just use:\n```python\nresults = pyco2.sys(par1, par2, **kwargs)\n```\nThe keys to the `results` dict are described in the documentation. Arguments should be provided as scalars or NumPy arrays in any mutually broadcastable combination. A large number of optional `kwargs` can be provided to specify everything beyond the carbonate system parameters — see the documentation for details.\n\nYou can also look at the interactive examples that you can try out without needing to install anything on your computer.\n\nPyCO2SYS is maintained by the Ocean Carbon Cycle Informatics System (OCOSIT) at the University of California, Santa Cruz with the support of the main developers of all previous versions of CO2SYS.\n\nContributions are welcome.

Seattle (WA), USA\n\nDistributed acoustic sensing or DAS, offers exciting new opportunities to eavesdrop on whales by converting existing fiber optic cables into dense listening arrays of strain sensors. It exploits the physics of Raleigh backscattering following the introduction of an interrogating pulse in the fiber, converting time-delays (or phase changes) of the backscattered pulses into strain measurements, analogous to acoustic pressure. DAS is also known as Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS), coherent backscattering, Phase Optical Time Domain Reflectometry ($\\Phi$-OTDR).\n\nFor a complete DAS technical overview see:\n>Hartog, A.

The optimal encounter rate policy in biological interaction between predator and prey is also dependent on the type of the movement that each of the predator/prey is taking and the velocity ratio of prey to predator.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/afshinfaramarzi/Marine-Predators-Algorithm/blob/master/shark-Img.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p>\n\nThe following highlights summarize the governing policies for the optimal foraging and interactions and memories in marine predators:\n\nMarine predators use Lévy strategy for the environment with a low concentration of prey while employing Brownian movement for the areas with abundant prey;\n  \nThey showed the same percentages of Lévy and Brownian movement during their lifetime of traversing different habitats; \n\nDue to the environmental effects such as natural (eddy formation) or human-caused (FADs), they change their behavior to hopefully find areas with a different distribution of prey;\n  \nIn low-velocity ratio (v=0.1), the best strategy for a predator is Lévy; either prey is moving in Brownian or Lévy;\n\nIn the unit velocity ratio (v=1), if prey moves in Lévy, the best strategy for a predator is Brownian. Other scenarios are dependent on system size;\n\nIn high-velocity ratio (v≥10) the best strategy for a predator is not moving at all. In this case, either prey is moving Brownian or Lévy; \n\nThey take advantage of good memory in reminding of their associates as well as the location of successful foraging.\n\n\nBased on the highlights, MPA optimization process is divided into three main phases of optimization considering different velocity ratio and at the same time mimicking the entire life of a predator and prey: (1) in high velocity ratio or when prey is moving faster than predator, (2) in unit velocity ratio or when both predator and prey are moving at almost same pace, and (3) in low velocity ratio when predator is moving faster than prey.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afshinfaramarzi/Marine-Predators-Algorithm/master/MPA-Phases.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\nBesides the three phases defined for optimization, some natural and human-caused environmental issues such as eddy formation and FAD’s effect are mathematically modeled to include in the MPA.\n\nMPA’s performance is evaluated against twenty-nine test functions, test suite of CEC-BC-2017, randomly generated landscape, three engineering benchmarks, and two real-world engineering design problems in the areas of ventilation and building energy performance. MPA is compared with three classes of existing optimization methods, including 1) GA and PSO as the most well-studied metaheuristics, 2) GSA, CS and SSA as almost recently developed algorithms and 3) CMA-ES, SHADE and LSHADE-cnEpSin as high performance optimizers and winners of IEEE CEC competition. Among all methods, MPA gained the second rank and demonstrated very competitive results compared to LSHADE-cnEpSin as the best performing method and one of the winners of CEC 2017 competition. The statistical post hoc analysis revealed that MPA can be nominated as a high-performance optimizer and is a significantly superior algorithm than GA, PSO, GSA, CS, SSA and CMA-ES while its performance is statistically similar to SHADE and LSHADE-cnEpSin. \n\nYou can download the main paper here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113377\n\nIf you don’t have access to the paper, just leave me a message at afaramar@hawk.iit.edu or afshin.faramarzi@gmail.com and I will get back to you soon.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Humphries, N.

PAMGuard provides users access to a suite of state-of-the-art automated analysis algorithms alongside displays for visualisation data and a comprehensive data management systems. \n\nPAMGuard fulfils two main requirements within marine bioacoustics\n\n1) Real time operation: Almost all PAMGuard features and modules work in real time this allows scientists and industry to detect, classify and localise the position of animals in real time on a standard consumer laptop, enabling mitigation and research surveys without expensive bespoke software solutions and the transparency of open source software.  \n\n2) Processing and visualisation of large datasets: Off-the-shelf autonomous PAM devices, large scale surveys involving drifters, towed arrays, gliders, bottom mounted devices and real time continuous monitoring system all generate huge volumes of data which requires automated analysis approaches. PAMGuard allows the processing of very large passive acoustic datasets using automated algorithms and crucially provides comprehensive visualisation tools for a manual analyst to check the results.\n\nPAMGuard is available on Windows and can be downloaded from the . Note that we are considering MacOS and Linux installers but they are not available at this time. \n\nPAMGuard is a modular program with two modes; real-time and viewer. Typically a user will start with real-time model, either in the field collecting data or post processing sound files from a recorder. Once data are processed, users move on to viewer mode where data can be explored and further processed. \n\nUpon opening PAMGuard for the first time you are greeted with a blank screen. You must add a series of modules to create the desired acoustic workflow this is referred to as PAMGuard data model. For example if processing sound files then first add the Sound Acquisition module File->Add Modules->Sound Processing->Sound Acquisition. Then add the desired detection algorithms e.g. File->Add Modules->Detector->Click Detectors. Some modules (such as the click detector) have their own bespoke displays, others are added to more generalised displays. For example, the whistle and moan detector module shows detections on a spectrogram display, time base display, map etc. First add a new tab using File->Add Modules->Displays->User Display. Click on the user display tab and then from the top menu select User display-> New Spectrogram. Right click on the added spectrogram and select whistle and moan contours to show whistle detections overlaid on the raw spectrogram. \n\nMake sure to add the database and binary file storage modules File->Add Modules->Utilities->... to save data then press the run button (red button) and data will process. PAMGuard can handle huge datasets so running might take hours or even days. Progress is shown on the bottom of the screen. \n\nOnce the data has run, open PAMGuard viewer mode. Select the database you used to process the data along and the binary file storage path and PAMGuard will open, showing an overview of the dataset in a new Data map tab. Right click anywhere on the data map and select \"Center data here\" PAMGuard will load the data for the selected period which can be explored using whichever displays have been added to the data model. \n\nPAMGuard connects with hardware such as various GPS and AIS systems and a multitude of different sound cards (e.g. devices, , almost all ASIO sound cards and standard computer sound cards) for real time data collection and processing. PAMGuard also works with some very bespoke hardware such as ;\n\nPAMGuard takes advantage of multi-core processors to run multiple signal processing automatic analysis algorithms in real time to detect whales, dolphins, bats etc. Data are shown in different displays, including interactive spectrograms and maps. You might be using PAMGuard for simply viewing a spectrogram and making recordings or running deep learning algorithms for multiple species and localising the results to view locations on a map. Whatever acoustic workflow a user creates, PAMGuard can run it in real time. \n\nPAMGuard supports processing audio data from standard files (e.g. wav, aif) and also compressed files (e.g. .flac and .sud). Note that sud files are created on SoundTraps widely used marine recorders and can be read by PAMGuard without decompressing PAMGuard will automatically import click detections if present in sud files. PAMGuard also supports importing detection data from CPODs and FPODs. \n\nPAMGuard is designed to collect/process data from large acoustic datasets. PAMGuard stores data in an SQLite databases and \"Binary\" files. The database stores important metadata such as when data has been processed and some low volume data streams such as GPS. Binary files are not human readable but efficient to access PAMGuard stores detection data (e.g. clicks, whistles, noise, etc) in these files. This allows PAMGuard to rapidly access data from large datasets. Data from binary files can be viewed in PAMGuard viewer mode or can be exported to MATLAB using the library or the exported to R using the R package. \n\nPAMGuard allows users to integrate automated detection and classification algorithms directly into their acoustic workflow. There are a multitude of different algorithms to choose from, including a basic click detector, whistle and moan detector, GPL detector, click train detectors and many others. The idea behind PAMGuard is allow researchers to access open source state-of-the-art algorithms developed within the scientific community if you want to contribute and get your algorithm into PAMGuard get in touch. \n\nThe PAMGuard click detector can be used to detect transient sounds such as echolocation clicks. It also automatically localises click bearings for closely spaced hydrophones. \n\nPAMGuard has a multitude of different options for acoustic localisation. There's a comprehensive beam forming module for beam forming arrays, a large aperture localiser for 3D localisation and target motion analysis for towed hydrophone arrays. \n\nPAMGuard has a noise band (which supports third octave noise bands) and long term spectral average module for soundscape analysis. \n\nAlmost all detection data can be visualised on a map. PAMGuard also supports plotting GPS and AIS data. \n\nAn important aspect of PAMGuard is the ability for users to explore processed data. PAMGuard allows users to visualise data at multiple different times scales, from inspecting individual waveforms microseconds long to datagrams showing detector output or soundscape metrics over days, weeks or even years.\n\nThe PAMGuard data map provides an overview of the entire processed dataset over days, weeks and even years.\n\nThe displays within PAMGuard support a variety of manual annotation tools. Users can add data to annotations in multiple ways, from simple text annotations to complex forms created by users. \n\nPAMGuard allows users to run their own deep learning models using the deep learning module. AI can therefore be integrated into PAMGuard workflows, allowing for more efficient analysis of data. \n\nPAMGuard Integrates with Tethys database. Users can export processed PAMGuard data to a Tethys database seamlessly; this feature is great for large scale projects or organisations with long term datasets. \n\nThere's lots of features we would like to add to PAMGuard. If you want to add a feature you can either code it up yourself in Java and submit a pull request or get in touch with us to discuss how to it might be integrated. Some smaller features might be in our roadmap anyway but larger features usually require funding. Some features we are thinking about (but do not necessarily have time for yet) are;\n\nSupport for decade noise bands (base 10 filter bank) in noise band monitor to meet European standards\nCapability to export data directly from PAMGuard e.g. as MAT files (in progress).\nAutomated test suite to make releases more stable. Note that unit and integration tests are also being slowly incorporated.\nSupport for ARM based computers (in progress). \nA graphical user interface and Python library for training PAMGuard compatible deep learning models. \n\nThis is the main code repository for the PAMGuard software and was created on 7 January 2022 from a revision r. If you are a PAMGuard developer, you should clone and branch this repository and share with any collaborators in your own workspace. When your work is ready, contact the PAMGuard team to have your changes merged back into this repo.\n\nPAMGuard uses Maven as build tool. \n\nPAMGuard is open source under the . \nIt is currently primarily managed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit within the .

This was created for educational purposes only on the author's personal time, and is released without any warranty whatsoever.\n\nThe protocol was reverse engineered by monitoring the packets between the device and the manufacturer's app. Hex dumps of the captured packets were compared against what the app displayed and was commanding to the device. Through some trial and error, a portion of the protocol was decoded.\n\nI've only built this on Linux, but it will probably work in Windows.\n\nRequires Qt 4 or To run, put your device in the water to turn it on, or shove a bit of wet paper cloth across the metal contacts for an in-air test (I don't recommend you do this too much, my experience has said running these in air isn't a good thing but it is for the consumer so it's probably fairly hardy). From your computer, a wifi network should appear (in my case it is T-POD-37A) and enter your wifi password as the manufacturer instructs. Then, run the program and hit the \"run\" button. The screen should start filling up with data.\n\nThis software has only been tested with the T-POD because it was the cheapest one money could buy, however I suspect the protocol will be very similar on the other variants since it has to interop with the same app. If you are using one of the other products I would be really interested to see a full log.\n\nOne of the things I have not fully experimented with is how the \"master\" password protocol works, and so I strictly used the default password.

Killer whales (aka orcas) often swim by these hydrophones (underwater microphones) and vocalize with a wide range of calls.\n\nThrough annual Microsoft hackathons since 2019 and with the volunteer efforts of many, we have trained and continue to refine a deep learning model to find these calls in live hydrophone audio. The model is at the core of the real time inference system we call OrcaHello which aims to help recover the endangered population of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) the iconic orcas that frequently seek salmon in Puget Sound, and also range annually from California to Alaska.

Currently all of these hotspots refer to images in dataset ArcticSealsData`test.csv` (1,314 records): Same format and distrbution of `train.csv`, suitable for cross-validation.\n\nEach record in the CSV files refers to a hotspot that the NOAA thermal detection system picked up and that was classified by a human into either \"Animal\" (true positive) or \"Anomaly\" (false positive). Each hotspot is unique (no duplicates). The column schema is as follows:\n\n`hotspot_id`: unique ID\n`timestamp`: GMT/UTC timestamp (always corresponds to thermal image timestamp)\n`filt_thermal16`: Filename of the 16-bit PNG containing the raw FLIR image data\n`filt_thermal8`: Filename of the 8-bit JPG containing the annotated FLIR image data (hotspots circled)\n`filt_color`: Filename of the 8-bit JPG containing a color image taken at or near the same time as the thermal image. The timestamp encoded in the filename may be different from the thermal timestamp by up to 60 seconds (but typically less than 1 second).\n`x_pos`/`y_pos`: Location of the hotspot in the thermal image\n`thumb_*`: Bounding box of the hotspot in the color image. **NOTE**: some of these values are negative, as the bounding box is always 512x512 even if the hotspot is at the edge of the image.\n`hotspot_type`: \"Animal\" or \"Anomaly\"\n`species_id`: \"Bearded Seal\", \"Ringed Seal\", \"UNK Seal\", \"Polar Bear\" or \"NA\" (for anomalies)\n\nIn the `data` directory there is also a `raw.csv` (14,910 records) containing all hotspot detections from the NOAA 2016 survey flights (includes more seals but also more types of animals, more anomalies, hotspots marked as duplicates, etc.).\n\nThe project is meant to accomodate many different approaches, frameworks, languages, etc. Linux is the primary supported dev environment, though some GUI tools are Windows-only.\n\nTeam members are welcome to add whatever code you like to this repo, but please follow these guidelines:\n\nPut your source code in its own directory inside the `src` directory.\nAdd a `README.md` file to your code directory explaining what your code does and how it works.\nIf there are dependencies that need to be installed and/or build steps that need to be performed, add any necessary code to the `build.bat` script to run the relevant package manager commands, compile steps, etc., to ensure your code is fully runnable locally.\n    Alternatively, it is also ok if your code only builds from within an IDE; if so just make a note of that in your `README.md`.\nIf applicable, add a script that runs your code to the root directory.

Ships, buoys in the river, bank of the river and railway bridge across the river show strong intensities in deep red color. When the ship is approaching the radar site (top center of the image), multi-path clutter makes the shape of the ship irregular and causes interruption to the neighbor ship. The radar image is in *range*-*azimuthformat (the vertical axis maps the *range*} units, and the horizontal denotes the *azimuth*)</sub>\n\nTraditional filter based methods (such as kalman filter KF) , which are embedded on the marine radar, could not resist the clutter interruption and ship occlusion in the narrow waterway. It reflects the equipment-embedded tracking method can not fit the association bug for target tracking in the heavy clutter environment. More sophisticated methods like extended object tracking (EOT), particle filters based method are tested but not work neither. \n\nThen the visual tracker KCF attracted our attention. Tracking by detecting visual features may solve the association problem. While we implemented KCF on radar object tracking, we found that KCF performs badly in the long-term tracking. It had been addressed in the . One common approach is to add more sophisticated feature which would maintain the discriminant of the tracker longer.  Since a Radar may track hundreds of objects simultaneously,  tracker designed for Radar should be light computing. The computing resource on marine radar could not afford those expensive features. One day we luckily discovered that relay-tracking of 3 KCF trackers with simple feature (only the intensity)  on the target named  could be successful during her lifetime in the monitoring zone.\n\nThat is the insightful idea from the experiment: a KCF is short-term tracker,  but integrate multiple KCFs, we could get a long-term tracker. Therefore we designed the proposed framework of MKCF. We did not build a math model at first, by contrast, we built the framework in favor of efficient numerical computing, which is suitable for automatic initializing and fusing KCF in the radar signal. The proposed framework succeeded to track all the objects in our experiments. It provides a novel approach to  solve the  engineering difficulty, and we do want to share it with the community. \n\nWhen I studied the handbook of data fusion [Liggins et al., 2008] for deducing the fusion equations,  I had noted that there was a connection between the maximum likelihood estimation and KCF. The unique circular shifting samples in KCF are similar to the particle samples in particle filters (PF) based visual tracking, if we choose the particle to be dense enough. The element in the Kernel matrix of KCF is in fact a likelihood function in PF, which measures the similarity between the reference and the candidate sample.  If we can explain the single KCF in the view point of maximum likelihood, of course it is natural to fusing multiple of KCF via the maximum likelihood technique.\n\nThe advantage of KCF is that, once get the Kernel matrix  in the reference, she try to learn the pattern  of the matrix. In the later frame, the convolution of the tested Kernel matrix  and  produce the response map, saying the probability of a sample to be the true target. Here we can see that the PF and KCF both relies heavily on the reference model of the target which is computed on the initial frame. KCF uses naive running average to update the reference model. It is simple in computing, but can not handle the multiple models of the true target in long-term tracking. Therefore there should be a on-off key (PSR) for updating.  The component of MKCF are independent KCF, which is dynamically initialized on different frame. Consequently, **MKCF maintains multiple instances of the true target in different time steps. This technique enhances the robustness of the tracker in long-term tracking without using time-consuming visual features. It works in radar signal and  also provides useful experience for the video oriented visual tracking.*<!---->\n\n\n\nYi Zhou, Tian Wang, Ronghua Hu, Hang Su, Yi Liu, Xiaoming Liu, Jidong Suo, Hichem Snoussi, Multiple Kernelized Correlation Filters (MKCF) for Extended Object Tracking Using X-band Marine Radar Data, in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 67, no. 14, pp. 3676-3688, J.

By no means, I wanna say a real project has to have a perfect architecture or be completely extendable. I believe every project has its purpose and by the time I started this one I wanted to make it as much maintainable, manageable and clean as possible. Something 100% doable!\n\nI wanted as well to apply the appropriated  to the common problems I would have during the development. Because its super easy to do, they are very well documented everywhere! \n\nAll of it respecting perfectly the  principles of  and maybe doing some TDD too ...\n\nAs you can tell this point, as I progressed over time, I've found more things to do in my life and I couldn't keep the same excitement as I had at the beginning. The project definitely doesn't have the \"best ofs\", but in my point of view its good enough to be maintainable and extendable, the code is also clean and well organized, I have implemented a few patterns for common problems and I tried to respect SOLID as much as possible, but for sure someone can find mistakes here and there. In my defense, a few facts have to be taken into account, this is a project done in a few months during my free time on the weekends, early mornings or evenings after working 8h and with no hopes to make money from it.\n\nA final note, the game is still unfinished, there is plenty of stuff that can be done regarding the behaviors or the enemies, guns, upgrades, achievements, craft system, audio and all the game design stuff that demands a lot of tweaks and is time consuming. Feel free to make pull requests and contribute. I eventually will make some progress on my own, but don't expect a release date.\n\nWith that being said, let's get into it.\n\nSince there are a few things to cover I split it into different parts which I will talk separately:\nThe  of the game;\nThe  of the game;\nThe entity system: player, enemies, doors, bullets and game mechanics;\nThe initialization of the systems and the static data;\n\nThe game is separated into two different  that work independently: \n  __Opening__ It contains a short introduction of the game, displays a cut scene with a background, a spacecraft and text dialogs that receive input to go ahead and write the next sentence. The presentation ends with a dark screen fade which makes the transition to the playable part of the game. The scene is mostly driven by the script , which contains the instructions to move the spacecraft and show the text dialog.\n  __Game__ Contains the playable part of the game: monsters, player, doors, rooms and elevator are all here. \n\nThe  is mostly driven by a pure C\n\nThe  elements that in someways interact with the player inherit from these two , the first always interact with the player and the second has states and can be switched on, off or inactive.\n  \nThe Model and UI communication is done using the following  and the  which allows to remove the ) between both layers of the application. In shorter words, the UI scripts implement an interface and subscribe to the events they are interested in, and the Model classes dispatch those events when they happen.\n\nAs the  code shows, once a listener subscribes the event register, all its events/interfaces are now ready to be notified by the game model.\n\nQuick examples: \n\nMost of the simple elements of the UI inherit from  and subscribe to the observer after the _Start()_ engine callback. However, more complex entities that have their own base class and perform their own subscription, such as . \n\nAt the bottom of the class  we have an example of the model code notifying the events that handle the door damage and destruction, _OnTakeDamage()_ and _Destroy()_ methods respectively.\n  \n\n\nInside the model, enemies inherit from the base class  conceiving the . Doors and Enemies can be shot, in that way, both implement  interface. Rooms are populated with doors and enemies during the initialization, then events are emitted to instantiate the views of these entities which are  kept by an  where the code can be found .\n\nIn order to use some gizmos and make the placing of the objects in the world easier all the UI of the rooms are already in the scene with their own IDs set when the editor starts, with that and reading the static  used to initialize each room the gizmos elements appear in the scene according to each door, enemy, floor, position of the camera and walls present in the UIRoom. See picture below.\n\n \n\nAlthough I didn't tweak values of the jump, movement and gun, The  is mostly done but not all the enemies are implemented, I stopped the work on the  behaviors and other  still have to be done. \n  \n\n\nBesides the internal initialization of each Monobehavior done on the _Awake()_ method, the main initialization is done by the __GameController__ instance placed in the scene, see below:\n\nThe script  receives the unity callback _Start()_, then creates an instance of the game model and broadcasts the game event _ICreateGame_.\n\nThe  script receives the _ICreateGame_ event and then starts the game properly.\n\nTo initialize most of the game entities some external information is needed, this data means different things for different entities, they could be the position where a enemy would be placed, the total health, an ids or all the enemies inside the room. All these  about an object is stored into a specific scriptable object which is shared across all the entities of that type, as the constructor of the class  illustrates, the data is a dependency injected during the creation of the object.\n\nA playable version is available .\n\nSee you space cowboy\""

Its mission is to provide free authoritative information on the oceans physical and biogeochemical state. The CopernicusMarine R package is developed apart from this programme and facilitates retrieval of information from <https://data.marine.copernicus.eu>. With the package you can:\n\nList available marine data for Copernicus and provide meta-information.\nDownload and use the data directly in R.\n\nCopernicus Marine offers access to their data services through a [Python application interface](https://pypi.org/project/copernicusmarine/). For R users this requires complex installation procedures and is difficult to maintain in a stable R package. The CopernicusMarine R package has a much simpler installation procedure (see below) and does not depend on third party software, other than packages available from .\n\nGet CRAN version\nGet development version on github\n\nThe package provides an interface between R and the Copernicus Marine services. Note that for some of these services you need an account and have to comply with [specific terms](https://marine.copernicus.eu/user-corner/service-commitments-and-licence). The usage section briefly shows three different ways of obtaining data from Copernicus:\n\nPlease check the manual for complete documentation of the package.\n\nDownloading a subset\nUnfortunately, downloading subsets is not operational in R due to some [technical issues](https://github.com/pepijn-devries/CopernicusMarine/issues/42). It seems that it might take some time to get this fixed. In the meantime, you could have a look at this .\n\nDownloading a complete Copernicus marine product\nIf you don’t want to subset the data and want the complete set, you can use the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), if these are available for your product. First you can list STAC files available for a specific product (and layer):\n\nDownloading the first file can be done with `cms_download_stac(stac_files[1,,drop = FALSE], tempdir())`, where the file would be stored in a temporary directory. By default the progress is printed as files can be very large and may take some time to download.\n\nCopernicus Web Map Tile Services (WMTS)\nWeb Map Tile Services (WMTS) allow to quickly plot pre-rendered images onto a map. This may not be useful when you need the data for analyses but is handy for quick visualisations, inspection or presentation of data. In R it is very easy to add WMTS layers to an interactive map using widgets. This is demonstrated with the example below (note that in the documentation the map is only shown statically and is not interactive).\n\nA Copernicus account comes with several terms of use. One of these is that you [properly cite](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4444611-how-to-cite-copernicus-marine-products-and-services) the data you use in publications. In fact, we also have credit the data used in this documentation, which can be easily done with the following code:\n\n[E.U.

This provides a working volume constrained by the 50 mm internal diameter and ~118 mm maximum gap between caps.\n\nThe top cap/bulkhead has 4×M10 threaded holes for accessories as part of BlueRobotic's hardware ecosystem. The assembled prototype is fitted with:\n\n4.5mm Wetlink penetrator for the tether cable\n10m rated pressure sensor\nWhite indicator LED\nPressure relief/test valve\n\nWhilst this prototype won't see properly deep water, this tube arrangement should be capable of  200m operation, and far deeper if an aluminium sleeve is used.\n\nCAD models and assemblies are in `/mechanical/tube/`. Off-the-shelf parts are in `/mechanical/tube/cots/`.\n\nA pair of 3D printed board mounts use the 4×M3 internal mounting holes in the bulkheads.\n\nCAD models and STL files are in `/mechanical/tube/`.\n\nThe tube itself doesn't have any features for mounting, so a pair of custom tube clamps were printed with the general goal of providing generic strap or wire mounting points. \n\nFiles are in `/mechanical/mount/`.\n\nCompatibility with the  has been maintained where possible building off of  for bring-up and early software tests.\n\nPCB's were designed with KiCAD Project files, gerbers and schematic PDF's are in `/electronics/`.\n\nA small collection of calculator spreadsheets were made to help during the design process these are in `/docs` and use Open Office `.ods` format.\n\nVersion 1.0 boards do have some minor issues which were tweaked during bench testing, so I'd recommend reviewing things thorough before copying anything into your designs.\n\nActing as the MicroMod 'carrier', providing the processor and function board connections, as well as regulation, I2C headers, and breakout pads for spare/conflicted IO. It also serves as the mounting interface for sensor payloads and custom hardware.\n\nIt's a 46×100 mm 1.6 mm 2-layer board with pretty relaxed fabrication requirements.\n\nBoth boards implement the ADIN1110 SPE transceiver in a similar manner to Sparkfun's function board, but exist as two variants which improve over the dev-kit by adding:\n\nCircuitry to act as a Class 10-12 PoDL power supply (aka PSE).\n\nVID circuitry to signal compliance as a Class 10-12 PoDL powered device (aka PD).\n\nThese boards only provide detection, not classification via SCCP, and as such runs in 'fast-start mode'.\n\nThe PCB's are A×B mm, 0.8mm thick, 2-layer boards which can be manufactured with commodity fabs. I just used the raw straight PCB edge-connector without issues, but for best practice and/or frequent insertion cycles the edge-connector should be bevelled.\n\nThe blog post describes PoDL circuit behaviour and integration in more detail.\n\nThe project was designed without assuming any specific sensors would be used, but I used these I2C sensors:\n\nTemperature & Humidity `SHTC3` via \nMotion `LSM6DSO` via \nDepth/Pressure `MS5837` via \n\nI used an ESP32 MicroMod processor board along with the Arduino toolchain. As such, there are external dependencies on the ESP32 Arduino core, , and Sparkfun packages for their , ,  and  libraries.\n\nI also depend on my own  library (external to this repo) for working with the pressure sensor.\n\nThe `/firmware` folder has some of the test-sketches written during testing:\n\n`spe-pse-io` Bench-test PoDL PSE behaviour with a simple state-machine\n`lsm6ds0-fifo-test` Configures and reads IMU samples periodically from the buffer\n`led-io-test` Rough test using Pololu's APA102 library to check the 2×24 LED rings\n`spe-eui-bridge` Transparent proxy of `electricui-embedded` packets with ADIN1110 raw buffers to serial ports.\n\nThese sketches weren't written to act as examples or as reference material, and should be treated accordingly.\n\nThe main firmware is actually rather straightforward, running a superloop which runs each sub-system at a defined rate. Sub-systems never block, and are generally only responsible for their own behaviour.\n\nThe user interface is built with , and can be built and run by invoking `arc start` from `/interface`.\n\nIt handles visualisation of data streaming off the sensor node, and provides additional statistics and logging.\n\nIf you're planning on replicating this project, or part of it, some additional points of interest:\n\nI'm happy to answer questions or help with design changes to suit your ocean research project.\nI'm also generally open to consulting work!\nFirmware is pretty specific to my own tooling and relies on external libraries for sensors and the Arduino ESP32 core.\nRead over BlueRobotics's guides for Wetlink penetrator use, enclosure assembly, pressure testing.\nDefinitely do remember to lubricate o-rings and the tube bulkheads as you slide them into the cylinder. It's very difficult to get them out dry...\nThe tube as designed and pictured is positively buoyant and might need additional ballast weight depending on your application and safety requirements around handling.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that the entire detailed conceptualisation, design, ordering, assembly, testing and writeup occurred in August. There were many late nights, and as a result some design choices were made with simplicity or time-frame in mind.\""

The detector was built using Facebook's DectronMore specifically, . Follow that repo's intructions on how to install Detectron2, , torchvision, , ,  and cython. I have also put together a  with specific package versions which you can follow (both guides will work). Although not yet tested, the boat detector should work with the original Linux release of DetectronOnce you are done, check the installation on your Python environment: You should be able to see the version of your Detectron2 (e.g., \"0.1\") if the installation was sucessful.\n\nClone and install this repo and its supporting packages (with your Detectron2 python environment activated on Anaconda prompt):\n\nTest the hybrid boat detector:\n\nYour output should look like .\n\nTo run the detector with sample data, simply call . The detector reads all *.jpgand *.pngimages on the subfolders inside of *\"./data/\"*. Each run will generate the following output on each subfolder: The highlighted images showing the final output of detected boats are located in *\"./positiveHybrid/\"*. Here's an example:\n\nRed bounding boxes indicate boats identified using small time series and a novel bi GMM system in the Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV). Midand large-sized boats are tipically recognized with the use of pre-trained end-to-end object detectors (yellow bounding boxes). The Hybrid system combines both outputs, resulting in a system capable of identifying boats ranging from pixel-level (~80 pixels of area) to large (>1,500 pixels of area). The output folders also contain two *.xlsxspreadsheets () that specify, for each image, how many boats were found, the detection certainty scores and individual bounding boxes coordinates. Note: **OD*indicates detection using pre-trained DL-based object detectors only, while **Hybrid*indicates the final, hybrid results.\n\n**Preliminary considerations**: this detector was developed to use small time series of three monitoring images captured 5 seconds apart from each other using a static camera. You can try different capture layouts, but please keep in mind the system's original intent and assumptions when using it.\n\n**Data placement and naming conventions**: place your images in subfolders inside of *\"./data/\"(as in the samples provided). Each scene should be represented by a group of three images named using the following convention \"prefix+YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.format\", where *prefixis the name of the site, and *formatis either *\".jpg\"or *\".png\"*. For example: consider a subfolder containing nine images (i.e., three groups of three images) for a test site called \"site1\":\n\n**Note**: your images need to be placed in **subfolders*from *\"./data/\"*. \n\n**Adjusting detection parameters**: If doing research or using your own data, change the hyper-parameters of *config.pyto test different backbones, thresholds, etc. Three hyper-parameters determine the detection sub-regions in the image to be considered by both the DSMV and end-to-end object detector: *upper_ylimit*, *DSMV_ylimitand *OD_ylimit*. Detection bounding boxes whose top-left y-coordinates fall outside these bands are ignored. When first using your data, manually determine the detection bands you wish to use for the DSMV (usually smaller, given that small vessels are only expected farther away from the camera), and the end-to-end object detector (larger band, considering that these detectors can identify mediumand large-sized boats alike). These detection bands are going to be fixed throught a whole detection session, thus we recommend dividing the data into individual \"layouts\" (e.g., camera position), where a set of detection bands is valid. These bands are useful for ignoring irrelevant regions of the image (e.g., skyline or stactic foreground closer to the camera). The *OD_detection_thresholddetermines detection score threshold for object detectors. Other hyper-parameters include the customand pre-trained models used and directories for inputs and outputs. Refer to the \"help\" describing each of them inside *config.py*. \n\n**Running the detection**: once your images are placed in *\"./data/\"and your inference parameters are set, run  and subfolders will be created with the outputs described above.\n\nTunai Porto Marques (tunaip@uvic.ca),\""

The continuous works are proposing multi-modal large language models (MLLM), empowering LLMs with the ability to sense multiple modality inputs through constructing a joint semantic space (e.g.visual-text space). Though significant success was achieved in LLMs and MLLMs, exploring LLMs and MLLMs in domain-specific applications that required domain-specific knowledge and expertise has been less conducted, especially for marine domain. Different from general-purpose MLLMs, the marine-specific MLLM is required to yield much more sensitive, informative, and scientific responses. In this work, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs optimized on huge amounts of readily available general-purpose training data show a minimal ability to understand domain-specific intents and then generate informative and satisfactory responses. To address these issues, we propose MarineGPT, the first vision-language model specially designed for the marine domain, unlocking the secrets of the ocean to the public. We present our Marine-5M dataset with more than 5 million marine image-text pairs to inject domain-specific marine knowledge into our model and achieve better marine vision and language alignment. Our MarineGPT not only pushes the boundaries of marine understanding to the general public but also offers a standard protocol for adapting a general-purpose assistant to downstream domain-specific experts.

The simulator is ideal for applications requiring high run-time performance, such as simulation of a swarm of autonomous marine vehicles or developing optimal vehicle control strategies using reinforcement learning techniques. ASVLite also has a low computational overhead making it ideal for on-board simulation for applications such as online learning for adaptation to changes in the environment. When simulating a swarm of ASVs, ASVLite takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, when available, by multi-threading the computation for each ASV on parallel threads. ASVLite has been implemented with a clear and simple programming interface written in the C programming language, making it easy to integrate with any existing or future software. Refer to the section  for details of the programming interface.\n\nIf you are using this simulator for your research, then please cite: .\n\nThe image below show visualisation of the ocean surface and three ASVs simulated by ASVLite.\n\nThe simulator requires the following values as command-line arguments:\ninput file, \noutput file,\nsignificant wave height of the sea state to simulate, \npredominant wave direction of the wave,\nrandom seed number.\n\nExample for simulating vehicle dynamics in a sea with a significant wave height of 1.2 m, wave heading of 20oNorth and with a random number seed of 3:\n\nThe `input_file` uses `toml` syntax and should provide the inputs required for the simulation.

With a uniform API to manipulate and access content across many devices, VDFS is not restricted to a single machine. It achieves this by maintaining a virtual index of all storage locations, synchronizing the database between clients in realtime. This implementation also uses  (Content-addressable storage) to uniquely identify files, while keeping record of logical file paths relative to the storage locations.\n\nThe first implementation of a VDFS can be found in this UC Berkeley  by Haoyuan Li. This paper describes its use for cloud computing, however the underlying concepts can be translated to open consumer software.\n\nMany of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.\n\nView a list of our planned features here: \n\nPlease refer to the  for how to install Spacedrive from sources.\n\nPlease refer to the  for details and information on how to responsibly report a security vulnerability or issue.\n\nThis project is using what I'm calling the **\"PRRTT\"*stack (Prisma, Rust, React, TypeScript, Tauri).\n\nPrisma on the front-end? 🤯 Made possible thanks to , developed by . Gives us access to the powerful migration CLI in development, along with the Prisma syntax for our schema. The application bundles with the Prisma query engine and codegen for a beautiful Rust API. Our lightweight migration runner is custom built for a desktop app context.\nTauri allows us to create a pure Rust native OS webview, without the overhead of your average Electron app. This brings the bundle size and average memory usage down dramatically. It also contributes to a more native feel, especially on macOS due to Safari's close integration with the OS.\nWe also use , created by Oscar Beaumont, which allows us to define functions in Rust and call them on the TypeScript frontend in a completely typesafe manner.\nThe core (`sdcore`) is written in pure Rust.\n\n`desktop`: A  app.\n`mobile`: A  app.\n`web`: A  webapp.\n`landing`: A  app using .\n`server`: A  server for the webapp.\n`cli`: A  command line interface.

Additional features of yabai include focus-follows-mouse, disabling animations for switching spaces, creating spaces past the limit of 16 spaces, and much more.\n\n\n\nThe yabai wiki has both brief and detailed installation instructions for multiple installation methods, and also explains how to uninstall yabai completely. Sample configuration files can be found in the examples directory. Refer to the documentation or the wiki for further information. Keyboard shortcuts can be defined with skhd or any other suitable software you may prefer.\n\n\n\nPlease read the below requirements carefully. Make sure you fulfil all of them before filing an issue.\n\n|Requirement|Note|\n|-:|:-|\n|Operating System Intel x86-64|Big Sur 11.0.0+, Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, Sonoma 14.0.0+, and Sequoia 15.0 is supported.|\n|Operating System Apple Silicon|Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, Sonoma 14.0.0+, and Sequoia 15.0 is supported.|\n|Accessibility API|yabai must be given permission to utilize the Accessibility API and will request access upon launch. The application must be restarted after access has been granted.|\n|Screen Recording|yabai must be given Screen Recording permission if and only if you want to enable window animations, and will request access when necessary. The application must be restarted after access has been granted.|\n|System Preferences (macOS 11.x, 12.x)|In the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" must be enabled.|\n|System Settings (macOS 13.x, 14.x, 15.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" must be enabled.|\n\nPlease also take note of the following caveats.\n\n|Caveat|Note|\n|-:|:-|\n|System Integrity Protection (Optional)|System Integrity Protection can be (partially) disabled for yabai to inject a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows with functions that require elevated privileges. This enables control of the window server, which is the sole owner of all window connections, and enables additional features of yabai.|\n|Code Signing|When building from source (or installing from HEAD), it is necessary to codesign the binary so it retains its accessibility and automation privileges when updated or rebuilt.|\n|Finder Desktop|Some people disable the Finder Desktop window using an undocumented defaults write command. This breaks focusing of empty spaces and should be avoided when using yabai. To re-activate the Finder Desktop, run: \"defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true\".|\n|NSDocument-based Applications|Windows that utilize native macOS tabs such as Terminal and Finder. Avoid creating tabs in these applications, consider alternatives that do not use NSDocument's tab system, or make these windows float using rules.|\n|System Preferences (macOS 11.x, 12.x)|In the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.|\n|System Settings (macOS 13.x, 14.x, 15.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.|\n|System Settings (macOS 14.x, 15.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting \"Show Items On Desktop\" should be enabled for display and space focus commands to work reliably in multi-display configurations.|\n|System Settings (macOS 14.x, 15.x)|In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting \"Click wallpaper to reveal Desktop\" should be set to \"Only in Stage Manager\" for display and space focus commands to work reliably.|\n\n\n\nyabai is licensed under the MIT License, a short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.

You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!\n\nWe're making an effort to internationalize the Npkill docs. Here's a list of the available translations:\n\n**Clear space:** Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.\n\n**Last Workspace Usage:** Check when was the last time you modified a file in the workspace (indicated in the last_mod column).\n\n**Very fast:** NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.\n\n**Easy to use:** Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)\n\n**Minified:** It barely has any dependencies.\n\nYou don't really need to install it to use it!\nSimply use the following command:\n\nOr if for some reason you really want to install it:\n\n> NPKILL does not support node<v If this affects you you can use npkill@0.8.3\n\nBy default, npkill will scan for node_modules starting at the path where npkill command is executed.\n\nMove between the listed folders with ↓ ↑, and use Space or Del to delete the selected folder. You can also use j and k to move between the results.\n\nYou can open the directory where the selected result is placed by pressing o.\n\nTo exit, Q or Ctrl c if you're brave.\n\n**Important!** Some applications installed on the system need their node_modules directory to work and deleting them may break them. NPKILL will highlight them by displaying a :warning: to be careful.\n\n| ARGUMENT                         | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -c, --bg-color                   | Change row highlight color.

Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03808.pdf\n\nWe have noticed a lot of concern that PULSE will be used to identify individuals whose faces have been blurred out. We want to emphasize that this is impossible PULSE makes imaginary faces of people who do not exist, which should not be confused for real people.*It will *not*help identify or reconstruct the original image.\n\nWe also want to address concerns of bias in PULSE. *We have now included a new section in the  and an accompanying model card directly addressing this bias.*--Table of Contents\n=================\nGiven a low-resolution input image, PULSE searches the outputs of a generative model (here, ) for high-resolution images that are perceptually realistic and downscale correctly.\n\nThe main file of interest for applying PULSE is `run.py`. A full list of arguments with descriptions can be found in that file; here we describe those relevant to getting started.\n\nYou will need to install cmake first (required for dlib, which is used for face alignment). Currently the code only works with CUDA installed (and therefore requires an appropriate GPU) and has been tested on Linux and Windows. For the full set of required Python packages, create a Conda environment from the provided YAML, e.g.\n\n\nor (Anaconda on Windows):\n\n\nIn some environments (e.g. on Windows), you may have to edit the pulse.yml to remove the version specific hash on each dependency and remove any dependency that still throws an error after running  (such as readline)\n\nto\n\nFinally, you will need an internet connection the first time you run the code as it will automatically download the relevant pretrained model from Google Drive (if it has already been downloaded, it will use the local copy). In the event that the public Google Drive is out of capacity, add the files to your own Google Drive instead; get the share URL and replace the ID in the https://drive.google.com/uc?=ID links in  and  with the new file ids from the share URL given by your own Drive file.\n\nBy default, input data for `run.py` should be placed in `./input/` (though this can be modified). However, this assumes faces have already been aligned and downscaled. If you have data that is not already in this form, place it in `realpics` and run `align_face.py` which will automatically do this for you. (Again, all directories can be changed by command line arguments if more convenient.) You will at this stage pic a downscaling factor.\n\nNote that if your data begins at a low resolution already, downscaling it further will retain very little information. In this case, you may wish to bicubically upsample (usually, to 1024x1024) and allow `align_face.py` to downscale for you.\n\nOnce your data is appropriately formatted, all you need to do is\n\nEnjoy!\""

The way the new window is inserted is determined by the value of the automatic scheme and the initial polarity settings.\n\nWhen the value of the automatic scheme is longest_side, the window will be attached as if the insertion point was in manual mode and the split direction was chosen based on the dimensions of the tiling rectangle and the initial polarity.\n\nLet's consider the following scenario, where the initial polarity is set to second_child:\n\nIn state X, a new window is added.\n\nSince 1 is wide, it gets split vertically and 2 is added as a's second child given the initial polarity.\n\nThis leads to Y where we insert window 3. 2 is tall and is therefore split horizontally. 3 is once again added as b's second child.\n\nWhen the value of the automatic scheme is alternate, the window will be attached as if the insertion point was in manual mode and the split direction was chosen based on the split type of the insertion point's parent and the initial polarity. If the parent is split horizontally, the insertion point will be split vertically and vice versa.\n\nWhen the value of the automatic scheme is spiral, the window will take the space of the insertion point.\n\nLet's dive into the details with the following scenario:\n\nIn state X, the insertion point, 2, is in automatic mode.\n\nWhen we add a new window, 4, the whole tree rooted at b is reattached, as the second child of a new internal node, c.\n\nThe splitting parameters of b(type: horizontal, ratio: ½) are copied to cand bis rotated by 90° clockwise.\n\nThe tiling rectangle of 4 in state Y is equal to the tiling rectangle of 2 in state X.\n\nThen the insertion of 5, with 4 as insertion point, leads to Z.\n\nThe spiral automatic scheme generates window spirals that rotate clockwise (resp. anti-clockwise) if the insertion point is the first (resp. second) child of its parent.\n\nThe RandR and Xinerama protocols.\nA subset of the EWMH and ICCCM standards.\n\nWant to get in touch with other bspwm users or you need help?

To disable this feature, remove or comment out the call to `reset_scene()` around line 735 in the main function.\nYou can provide a seed to the `generate_spaceship()` function to always generate the same spaceship. For example, `generate_spaceship('michael')`.\nThe `generate_spaceship()` function takes many more parameters that affect the generation process. Try playing with them!\nYou can replace the textures with your own ones. All textures are applied using global-space cube UVs. `hull_normal.png` is a normal map that adds extra surface \"greebles\". `hull_lights_diffuse.png` is an additive diffuse texture to set the color of the window lights. `hull_lights_emit.png` is an emissive texture to make the windows glow in darkness.\n\nCredits\nWritten for fun as part of the  June 2016 .\n\nReleased under the [MIT License].\n\nAuthored and maintained by Michael Davies.\n\n> GitHub \n> Twitter \n\nSpecial thanks to  for bugfixes, a proper GUI and build script.

It is an Android application that leverages on-device sensors to provide monitoring and protection of physical areas. Haven turns any Android phone into a motion, sound, vibration and light detector, watching for unexpected guests and unwanted intruders. We designed Haven for investigative journalists, human rights defenders and people at risk of forced disappearance to create a new kind of herd immunity. By combining the array of sensors found in any smartphone, with the world's most secure communications technologies, like Signal and Tor, Haven prevents the worst kind of people from silencing citizens without getting caught in the act.\n\nView our full  presentation for more about the origins and goals of the project.\n\n\n\nWe are announcing Haven today, as an open-source project, along with a public beta release of the app. We are looking for contributors who understand that physical security is as important as digital, and who have an understanding and compassion for the kind of threats faced by the users and communities we want to support. We also think it is cool, cutting-edge and making use of encrypted messaging and onion routing in whole new ways. We believe Haven points the way to a more sophisticated approach to securing communication within networks of things and home automation system.\n\nLearn more about the story of this project at the links below:\n\nHaven was developed through a collaboration between  and . Prototype funding was generously provided by FPF, and donations to support continuing work can be contributed through their site: https://freedom.press/donate-support-haven-open-source-project/\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven only records when triggered by sound and motion and stores everything locally on the device. You can position the device's camera to capture visible motion or place your phone somewhere discreet to listen for noises. Receive secure notifications of intrusion events instantly or access logs remotely later.\n\nThe following sensors are monitored for a measurable change, and then recorded to an event log on the device:\n\nAccelerometer: phone's motion and vibration\nCamera: motion in the phone's visible surroundings from front or back camera\nMicrophone: noises in the environment\nLight: change in light from ambient light sensor\nPower: detect device being unplugged or power loss  \n\n\n\nThe application can be built using Android Studio and Gradle. It relies on a number of third-party dependencies, all of which are free, open-source, and listed at the end of this document.\n\n\n\nYou can currently get the Haven BETA release in one of three ways:\n\nDownload \nFirst,  the open-source app store, and second, add our Haven Nightly \"Bleeding Edge\" repository by scanning the QR Code below:\n\nor add this repository manually in F-Droid's Settings->Repositories: \n\nGrab the APK files from the \n\nYou can, of course, build the app yourself, from source.\n\nIf you are an Android developer, you can learn more about how you can make use of F-Droid in your development workflow, for nightly builds, testing, reproducibility and more here: \n\n\n\nWhile we hope to support a version of Haven that runs directly on iOS devices in the future, iPhone users can still benefit from Haven today. You can purchase an inexpensive Android phone for less than $100 and use it as your \"Haven Device\"; leaving it behind whilst you keep your iPhone on you. If you run Signal on your iPhone you can configure Haven on Android to send encrypted notifications, with photos and audio, directly to you. If you enable the \"Tor Onion Service\" feature in Haven (requires installation of \"Orbot\" app as well) you can remotely access all Haven log data from your iPhone using the Onion Browser app.\n\nSo, no, iPhone users we didn't forget about you and we hope you will pick up an inexpensive Android burner today!\n\n\n\nHaven is meant to provide a smooth onboarding experience that walks users through configuring the sensors on their device to best detect intrusions into their environment. The current implementation has some of this implemented, but we are looking to improve this user experience dramatically.\n\n\n\nThe application's main view allows the user to select which sensors to use along with their corresponding levels of sensitivity. A security code is required to disable monitoring, which must be provided by the user. A phone number can be set, to which a message will be sent if any of the sensors are triggered.\n\n\n\nWhen one of the sensors is triggered (reaches the configured sensitivity threshold), notifications are sent through the following channels (if enabled):\n\nSMS: a message is sent to the number specified when monitoring started\nSignal: if configured, can send end-to-end encryption notifications via Signal\n\nNote that it is not necessary to install the Signal app on the device that runs Haven. Doing so may invalidate the app's previous Signal registration and safety numbers. Haven uses normal APIs to communicate via Signal.\n\nNotifications are sent through a service running in the background that is defined in class `MonitorService`.\n\n\n\nAll event logs and captured media can be remotely accessed through a . Haven must be configured as an Onion Service and requires the device to also have  installed and running. \n\n\n\nThis project contains source code or library dependencies from the following projects:\n\nSecureIt project available at: https://github.com/mziccard/secureit Copyright (c) 2014 Marco Ziccardi (Modified BSD)\nlibsignal-service-java from Open Whisper Systems: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-service-java (GPLv3)\nGuardian Project fork of signal-cli from AsamK: https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli , https://github.com/guardianproject/signal-cli-android (GPLv3)\nJayDeep's AudioWife: https://github.com/jaydeepw/audio-wife (MIT)\nAppIntro: https://github.com/apl-devs/AppIntro (Apache 2)\nGuardian Project's NetCipher: https://guardianproject.info/code/netcipher/ (Apache 2)\nNanoHttpd: https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd (BSD)\nMaterialDateTimePicker from wdullaer: https://github.com/wdullaer/MaterialDateTimePicker (Apache 2)\nFresco Image Viewer: https://github.com/stfalcon-studio/FrescoImageViewer (Apache 2)\nFacebook Fresco Image Library: https://github.com/facebook/fresco (BSD)\nAudio Waveform Viewer: https://github.com/derlio/audio-waveform (Apache 2)\nFireZenk's AudioWaves: https://github.com/FireZenk/AudioWaves (MIT)\nMaxYou's SimpleWaveform: https://github.com/maxyou/SimpleWaveform (MIT)\nSiralam's fork of CameraViewPlus: https://github.com/siralam/CameraViewPlus (Apache License 2.0)\nHalil Ozercan's BetterVideoPlayer: https://github.com/halilozercan/BetterVideoPlayer\nReneto Silva's easyrs: https://github.com/silvaren/easyrs (MIT)\nGoogle's libphonenumber: https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber (Apache License 2.0)\nMike Penz's AboutLibraries: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries (Apache License 2.0)\""

You see many more details such as textures on mountains and valleys, and for the first time a neat shading and even shadows. Sure, it's pixelated, but all games in those years were pixelated.\n\nuses a technique called , which is based on the same ideas like . Hence the Voxel Space engine is a 2.5D engine, it doesn't have all the levels of freedom that a regular 3D engine offers.\n\nThe easiest way to represent a terrain is through a height map and color map. For the game Comanche a 1024 x 1024 one byte height map and a 1024 x 1024 one byte color map is used which you can download on this site. These maps are periodic:\n\nSuch maps limit the terrain to \"one height per position on the map\" Complex geometries such as buildings or trees are not possible to represent. However, a great advantage of the colormap is, that it already contains the shading and shadows. The Voxel Space engine just takes the color and doesn't have to compute illumination during the render process.\n\nFor a 3D engine the rendering algorithm is amazingly simple. The Voxel Space engine rasters the height and color map and draws vertical lines. The following figure demonstrate this technique.\n\nClear Screen.\nTo guarantee occlusion start from the back and render to the front. This is called painter algorithm.\nDetermine the line on the map, which corresponds to the same optical distance from the observer. Consider the field of view and the (Objects are smaller farther away)\nRaster the line so that it matches the number of columns of the screen.\nRetrieve the height and color from the 2D maps corresponding of the segment of the line.\nPerform the for the height coordinate.\nDraw a vertical line with the corresponding color with the height retrieved from the perspective projection.\n\nThe core algorithm contains in its simplest form only a few lines of code (python syntax):\n\nWith the algorithm above we can only view to the north. A different angle needs a few more lines of code to rotate the coordinates.\n\nThere are of course a lot of tricks to achieve higher performance.\n\nInstead of drawing from back to the front we can draw from front to back. The advantage is, the we don't have to draw lines to the bottom of the screen every time because of occlusion. However, to guarantee occlusion we need an additional y-buffer. For every column, the highest y position is stored. Because we are drawing from the front to back, the visible part of the next line can only be larger then the highest line previously drawn.\nLevel of Detail. Render more details in front but less details far away.\n\n[Web Project demo][project demo] page\n\nThe software part of the repository is under the MIT license. Please read the license file for more information. Please keep in mind, that the Voxel Space technology might be still in some countries.

Instead, it _exposes your database over an external API_ that can be consumed directly from the frontend. In other words, it **allows clients to fire database queries directly**.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that **the client does not send database (SQL) queries*to Space Cloud. Instead, it sends an object describing the query to be executed. This object is first **validated*by Space Cloud (using security rules). Once the client is authorized to make the request, **a database query is dynamically generated and executed**. The results are sent directly to the concerned client.\n\nWe understand that not every app can be built using only CRUD operations. Sometimes it's necessary to write business logic. For such cases, Space Cloud allows you to access your **custom HTTP servers*via the same consistent APIs of Space Cloud.

Yet, the increasing demands of the Internet's growth demand a higher performant network processing solution. Kernel bypass has emerged to catch more and more attention. There are various similar technologies such as: DPDK, NETMAP and PF_RING. The main idea of kernel bypass is that Linux is only used to deal with control flow; all data streams are processed in user space. Therefore, kernel bypass can avoid performance bottlenecks caused by kernel packet copying, thread scheduling, system calls, and interrupts. Furthermore, kernel bypass can achieve higher performance with multi-optimizing methods. Within various techniques, DPDK has been widely used because of its more thorough isolation from kernel scheduling and active community support.\n\nis an open source high performant network framework based on DPDK with the following characteristics:\n\nUltra high network performance which the network card can achieve under full load: 10 million concurrent connections, 5 million RPS, 1 million CPS.\nTransplant FreeBSD 11.01 user space stack, which provides a complete stack function, and cut a great amount of irrelevant features. This greatly enhances network performance.\nSupport Nginx, Redis, and other mature applications. Services can easily use F-Stack.\nEasy to extend with multi-process architecture.\nProvides micro thread interface. Various applications with stateful applications can easily use F-Stack to get high performance without processing complex asynchronous logic.\nProvide an Epoll/Kqueue interface that allow many kinds of applications to easily use F-Stack.\n\nTo deal with the increasingly severe DDoS attacks, the authorized DNS server of Tencent Cloud DNSPod switched from Gigabit Ethernet to 10-Gigabit at the end of 2016. We faced several options: one is to continue to use the original network stack in the Linux kernel, another is to use kernel bypass techniques. After several rounds of investigation, we finally chose to develop our next generation of DNS server based on DPDK. The reason is DPDK provides ultra-high performance and can be seamlessly extended to 40G, or even 100G NIC, in the future.\n\nAfter several months of development and testing, DKDNS, high-performance DNS server based on DPDK, officially released in October. It's capable of achieving up to 11 million QPS with a single 10GE port and 18.2 million QPS with two 10GE ports. And then we developed a user-space TCP/IP stack called F-Stack that can process 0.6 million RPS with a single 10GE port.\n\nWith the fast growth of Tencent Cloud, more and more of our services needed higher network access performance. Meanwhile, F-Stack was continuing to improve, being driven by our business growth, and, ultimately developed into a general network access framework. But our initial TCP/IP stack couldn't meet the needs of these services. Continuing to develop and maintain a complete high performance network stack would have been too expensive. After evaluating several plans, we finally determined to port FreeBSD's (13.0 stable) TCP/IP stack into F-Stack. Not only does this allow us to stop reinventing the wheel, we can take advantage of the the improvements the FreeBSD community will bring in the future. Thanks to  and  this work became a lot easier.\n\nWith the rapid development of all kinds of applications, in order to help different APPs quickly and easily use F-Stack, F-Stack has integrated Nginx, Redis and other commonly used APPs, and a micro thread framework, and provides a standard Epoll/Kqueue interface.\n\nCurrently, besides authorized DNS server of DNSPod, there are various products in Tencent Cloud has used the F-Stack, such as HttpDNS (D+), COS access module, CDN access module, etc.\n\n```\nmkdir -p /data/f-stack\ngit clone https://github.com/F-Stack/f-stack.git /data/f-stack\n```\n\n```\nyum install numactl-devel          \n```\n\n```\npip3 install pyelftools --upgrade\n```\n\n```\nsudo apt install python \n```\n\n```\ncd f-stack\ncd dpdk/\nmeson -Denable_kmods=true -Ddisable_libs=flow_classify -Ddisable_drivers=crypto/openssl build\nninja -C build\nninja -C build install\n```\n\n```\necho 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\n```\n\n```\necho 1024 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\necho 1024 > /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\n```\n\n```\nmkdir /mnt/huge\nmount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge\n```\n\n```\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n```\n\n```\nmodprobe uio\ninsmod /data/f-stack/dpdk/build/kernel/linux/igb_uio/igb_uio.ko\ninsmod /data/f-stack/dpdk/build/kernel/linux/kni/rte_kni.ko carrier=on \npython dpdk-devbind.py --status\nifconfig eth0 down\npython dpdk-devbind.py --bind=igb_uio eth0 \n```\n\n```\nsudo apt install gcc make libssl-dev                            \n```\n\n```\nexport FF_PATH=/data/f-stack\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig\ncd /data/f-stack/lib/\nmake    \n```\n\n```\nmake install    \n```\n\n```\ncd app/nginx-1.25.2\nbash ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx_fstack --with-ff_module\nmake\nmake install\ncd ../..\n/usr/local/nginx_fstack/sbin/nginx\n```\n\nFor more details, see .\n\n\n```\ncd app/redis-6.2.6/deps/jemalloc\n./autogen.sh \ncd ../..\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\nIf KNI is enabled in the configuration file, you should create a virtual NIC after F-Stack started, and set the ipaddr, netmask, mac addr, route table, etc. These addrs must be same with F-Stack.\n\nIf you don't have another management port, you should execute a script like this.\n\n```\n/usr/local/nginx_fstack/sbin/nginx\nsleep 10\nifconfig veth0 <ipaddr>  netmask <netmask>  broadcast <broadcast> hw ether <mac addr>\nroute add -net 0.0.0.0 gw <gateway> dev veth0\necho 1 > /sys/class/net/veth0/carrier \n```\n\nTest environment\n\n- NIC: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFPCPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v3 @ 2.30GHz (NUMA)\n- Memory: 128G\n- OS: CentOS Linux release 7.2 (Final)\n- Kernel: 3.10.104-1-tlinux2-0041.tl2\n\nNginx uses Linux kernel's default config, all soft interrupts are working in the first CPU core.\n\nNginx si means modify the smp_affinity of every IRQ, so that the decision to service an interrupt with a particular CPU is made at the hardware level, with no intervention from the kernel.\n\nNginx Reuseport means enable \"reuseport\" in `nginx.conf`.\n\nNginx_FStack's 600 cache bytes' body was returned directly in nginx.conf.\n\nAll of these test cases use CPUs' physical cores.\n\nCPS (Connection:close, Small data packet) test result\n\nCPS_Reuseport (Connection:close, Small data packet) test result, This test case runs in a different test environment\n\nRPS (Connection:Keep-Alive, Small data packet) test data\n\nBandwidth (Connection:Keep-Alive, 3.7k bytes data packet) test data\n\nSee .\n\n\nTencent Cloud F-Stack team developed F-Stack which is a general network framework based on DPDK and provides ultra high network performance.

Qi, Li (Eric) Yi, Hao Su, Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University.\n\nIf you find our work useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n        @article{qi2017pointnetplusplus,\n          title={PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space},\n          author={Qi, Charles R and Yi, Li and Su, Hao and Guibas, Leonidas J},\n          journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.02413},\n          year={2017}\n        }\n\nThis work is based on our NIPS'17 paper. You can find arXiv version of the paper here or check project webpage for a quick overview. PointNet+ is a follow-up project that builds on and extends PointNet. It is version 2.0 of the PointNet architecture.\n\nPointNet (the v1 model) either transforms features of individual points independently or process global features of the entire point set. However, in many cases there are well defined distance metrics such as Euclidean distance for 3D point clouds collected by 3D sensors or geodesic distance for manifolds like isometric shape surfaces. In PointNet+, we want to respect spatial localities of those point sets. PointNet+ learns hierarchical features with increasing scales of contexts, just like that in convolutional neural networks. Besides, we also observe one challenge that is not present in convnets (with images) - non-uniform densities in natural point clouds. To deal with those non-uniform densities, we further propose special layers that are able to intelligently aggregate information from different scales.\n\nIn this repository we release code and data for our PointNet+ classification and segmentation networks as well as a few utility scripts for training, testing and data processing and visualization.\n\nInstall TensorFlow. The code is tested under TF1.2 GPU version and Python 2.7 (version 3 should also work) on Ubuntu 14. There are also some dependencies for a few Python libraries for data processing and visualizations like cv2, h5py etc. It's highly recommended that you have access to GPUs.\n\nThe TF operators are included under tf_ops, you need to compile them (check tf_xxx_compile.sh under each ops subfolder) first. Update nvcc and python path if necessary. The code is tested under TF1.2. If you are using earlier version it's possible that you need to remove the -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 flag in g+command in order to compile correctly.\n\nTo compile the operators in TF version >=1.4, you need to modify the compile scripts slightly.\n\nFirst, find Tensorflow include and library paths.\n\n        TF_INC=$(python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.sysconfig.get_include())')\n        TF_LIB=$(python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.sysconfig.get_lib())')\n        \nThen, add flags of -I$TF_INC/external/nsync/public -L$TF_LIB -ltensorflow_framework to the g++ commands.\n\nTo train a PointNet+ model to classify ModelNet40 shapes (using point clouds with XYZ coordinates):\n\n        python train.py\n\nTo see all optional arguments for training:\n\n        python train.py -h\n\nIf you have multiple GPUs on your machine, you can also run the multi-GPU version training (our implementation is similar to the tensorflow cifar10 tutorial):\n\n        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_multi_gpu.py --num_gpus 2\n\nAfter training, to evaluate the classification accuracies (with optional multi-angle voting):\n\n        python evaluate.py --num_votes 12 \n\n<i>Side Note:</i> For the XYZ+normal experiment reported in our paper: (1) 5000 points are used and (2) a further random data dropout augmentation is used during training (see commented line after augment_batch_data in train.py and (3) the model architecture is updated such that the nsample=128 in the first two set abstraction levels, which is suited for the larger point density in 5000-point samplings.\n\nTo use normal features for classification: You can get our sampled point clouds of ModelNet40 (XYZ and normal from mesh, 10k points per shape) here (1.6GB). Move the uncompressed data folder to data/modelnet40_normal_resampled\n\nTo train a model to segment object parts for ShapeNet models:\n\n        cd part_seg\n        python train.py\n\nPreprocessed ShapeNetPart dataset (XYZ, normal and part labels) can be found here (674MB). Move the uncompressed data folder to data/shapenetcore_partanno_segmentation_benchmark_v0_normal\n\nSee scannet/README and scannet/train.py for details.\n\nWe have provided a handy point cloud visualization tool under utils. Run sh compile_render_balls_so.sh to compile it and then you can try the demo with python show3d_balls.py The original code is from here.\n\nYou can refer to here on how to prepare your own HDF5 files for either classification or segmentation. Or you can refer to modelnet_dataset.py on how to read raw data files and prepare mini-batches from them. A more advanced way is to use TensorFlow's dataset APIs, for which you can find more documentations here.\n\nOur code is released under MIT License (see LICENSE file for details).\n\n02/23/2018: Added support for multi-gpu training for the classification task.\n02/23/2018: Adopted a new way for data loading. No longer require manual data downloading to train a classification network.\n02/06/2018: Added sample training code for ScanNet semantic segmentation.\n\n<a href=\"http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet\" target=\"_blank\">PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation</a> by Qi et al.

The space you have for an image may be portrait on a laptop, landscape on a tablet, and square on a mobile particularly if you're using a full-screen image.\n\nIf you have to use the same image file in all these contexts, you might not be happy with the results you get when you 'fill' the allocated space with your image. Your subject might be clipped or completely missing, or just really awkward looking.\n\nFocusPoint makes sure your image looks great in any container, by ensuring the 'spare' parts of your image (negative space) are cropped out before the important parts.\n\nFor a quick overview of the plugin check out this .\n\nHere are some examples showing the same image cropped a variety of different ways at once. Make sure you play with resizing the browser window to get a feel for what FocusPoint does.\n\nAnd here is a  demo.\n\nThe idea is that most images have a focal point or subject that is the most important part of the image. In the case of a traditional portrait photo this would be the subject's face (or specifically the spot right between their eyes). In the image above it's arguably the point halfway between the two people's faces.\n\nFocusPoint requires you to indicate where this focal point is located within your image, and then works in the background to ensure that point is never cropped out.\n\nAn image's focus point is made up of x (horizontal) and y (vertical) coordinates. The value of a coordinate can be a number with decimal points anywhere between -1 and +1, where 0 is the centre. X:-1 indicates the left edge of the image, x:1 the right edge. For the y axis, y:1 is the top edge and y:-1 is the bottom.\n\nConfused? Don't worry, there's a handy script included to help you find the focus coordinates of an image with a single click. Check out the  *(vastly improved courtesy of ). You'll need to include jQuery (v1.9 or greater), the FocusPoint script, and FocusPoint css file. Example:\n\nSpecify the image dimensions and focus point coordinates on the image container. The image will take up whatever space is available in the container, so make sure there is some space to fill by setting a height for the container in your CSS. Example:\n\nNote: setting `data-image-w` and `data-image-h` is optional but recommended. Omitting these value means your image will not be positioned correctly inside the frame until it has finished loading, which may cause a visible jump.\n\nUsually the best place for this will be inside your `$(document).ready()` function.\n\nThat's it!\n\nFocusPoint comes with a few options you can change to suit your needs.\n\n| Option                 | Values                | Default | Description |\n| ---------------------| --------------------| ------| ----------|\n| `reCalcOnWindowResize` | `true` or `false`     | `true`  | Whether or not to re-adjust image when the window is resized |\n| `throttleDuration`     | Int e.g. `0` or `100` | `17`    | Throttling rate in milliseconds. Set to `0` to disable throttling. |\n\nExample usage:\n\nOnce you have initialised FocusPoint on an image container you can access FocusPoint methods like this: `$(someContainer).data('focusPoint').methodName()`.\n\nOr the shorter way, like this: `$(someContainer).focusPoint('methodName')`\n\n| Function        | Description |\n| --------------| ----------|\n| `adjustFocus()` | Re-do calculations and re-position an image in it's frame. Call if container dimensions change. |\n| `windowOn()`    | Start window event listener and re-focus image when window is resized |\n| `windowOff()`   | Stop re-focusing image when window is resized |\n\nCurrently FocusPoint can't do it's calculations properly if an image container or it's parent is set to `display:none`, as it won't have any dimensions. This can cause problems with sliders that hide non-active slides. A work-around for now is to trigger `adjustFocus()` on the image container as soon as it become visible.\n\nIn order for this concept of 'fluid cropping' to work well, your images will need to include some negative space around the subject that you are happy to be cropped out when necessary. You don't need space on every side of the subject but for maximum flexibility you'll want to include both some vertical and horizontal negative space.\n\nYou can get a similar effect to this technique using only CSS and the `background-position` and `background-size` properties. Browser support isn't as good (at the moment) and your image won't be positioned exactly the same way but it's pretty close. The CSS technique leans towards preserving the original composition while FocusPoint is biased towards keeping the subject of the image in the centre of the frame. Depending on your requirements either technique may suit you better.\n\nThis plugin plays really well with the  module, which lets you set the focuspoint on any image with just a click, and makes the info available in your front-end templates so you don't have to do any math. It also provides really easy 'destructive' cropping outputting resampled images cropped to a particular width and height based on the same logic.\n\nNothing would encourage me to keep updating this script more than hearing how it's been used in the real world. Get in touch with me at  to let me know how you've used this plugin or any suggestions you have for improving it. Please .\n\nNote: To date I'm not yet aware of any live websites (apart from my own) that use this plugin so please get in touch if you launch a site that uses FocusPoint!\n\nIf FocusPoint helped you impress a client and you want to say thanks, you're welcome to  to help fund the purchase of coffee, which will help me stay awake during future development.\n\nDonations received / Warm fuzzies generated: **6*Caffé Lattes funded: **17*:coffee: :relieved:\n\nThanks!

By placing the class token at middle, Vim achieves improved results. Further details can be found in code and our updated .\n\nWe released our paper on Arxiv. Code/Models are coming soon. Please stay tuned! ☕️\n\n\n\nRecently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation & memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8x faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248xThe results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation & memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/vim_teaser_v1.7.png\" />\n</div>\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/vim_pipeline_v1.9.png\" />\n</div>\n\n\n\nPython 3.10.13\n\n  conda create -n your_env_name python=3.10.13\n\ntorch 2.1.1 cu118\n  pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n\nRequirements: vim_requirements.txt\n  pip install -r vim/vim_requirements.txt\n\nInstall ``causal_conv1d`` and ``mamba``\n  pip install -e causal_conv1d>=1.1.0\n  pip install -e mamba-1p1p1\n  \n   \n\nbash vim/scripts/pt-vim-t.sh\n\n\nbash vim/scripts/ft-vim-t.sh\n\n\n\n| Model | \n|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|     |       7M       |   76.1   | 93.0 | https://huggingface.co/hustvl/Vim-tiny-midclstok |\n|     |       7M       |   78.3   | 94.2 | https://huggingface.co/hustvl/Vim-tiny-midclstok |\n|     |       26M       |   80.5   | 95.1 | https://huggingface.co/hustvl/Vim-small-midclstok |\n|     |       26M       |   81.6   | 95.4 | https://huggingface.co/hustvl/Vim-small-midclstok |\n|     |       98M       |   81.9   | 95.8 | https://huggingface.co/hustvl/Vim-base-midclstok |\n\n**Notes:*<sup>+</sup> means that we finetune at finer granularity with short schedule.\n\nTo evaluate `Vim-Ti` on ImageNet-1K, run:\n\n\nThis project is based on Mamba (, ), Causal-Conv1d (), DeiT (, ).

If you are unfamiliar with spacemacs, you can visit  for more about the principle behind that, which is also what space-vim seeks.\n\nThe distribution is completely customizable using `.spacevim`, which is equivalent to `.spacemacs` in spacemacs.\n\n(Terminal vim with )\n\n\n\n**Beautiful interface:**I wrote a dark only vim colorscheme  based on the dark version of spacemacs-theme previously.

Since some guys are interested in the statusline part of space-vim, this section has been extracted as .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent Vim(NeoVim) version is recommended, for space-vim has been specifically optimized for Vim8 and NeoVim with respect to the startup time.\n\n is an easy way to install software on Windows, tools like `fzf`, `rg`, `ag` are necessary to get you a full-featured space-vim.\n\n:exclamation: ~~When layers enabled at the first time, you need to run `:PlugInstall` to install relevant plugins~~.\n\n\n\n`/path/to/space-vim` may be `~/.vim` (Vim), `~/.config/nvіm` (Neovim), or elsewhere. Installing space-vim to the conventional Vim/Neovim install location mitigates the need for an extra symlink to where space-vim is installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easist way is to download  and **run it as administrator**, or .\n\n\n\n\n\nClone :\n\n\n    \n\nInstall , refer to vim-plug installation section for more information:\n    \n\nCreate the symlinks and install plugins:\n\n    **Linux and macOS*You can use `.spacevim` in your home directory to customize space-vim, where you can enable the existing layers, add your extra plugins and private configurations.\n\nIf `.spacevim` does not exist, vanilla vim will be loaded! Refer to  as an example.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to  to take a look at the whole shipped layers.\n\nBasically, `g:spacevim_layers` almost takes the place of `Layer` command. As far as I known, most people never use the option of `Layer` command, e.g., `exclude`, so `g:spacevim_layers` could save a lengthy `Layer` list, requiring less ceremony. Nevertheless, `Layer` command is still avaiable for some advanced uses.\n\nIf you have a heavy customized configuration, you can organize them in *privatedirectory with `packages.vim` and `config.vim` too, which will be loaded on startup. The *privatedirectory can be considered as either a single layer, i.e., in which you can put packages.vim and config.vim, or a set of multiple layers.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I recommend you to look through the existing key bindings via `SPC ?`. What's more, you definitely can not miss reading the README of , which is of great importance for you to get started quickly.\n\nFor detailed instruction, please refer to the README under the certain layer enabled, or you can see config.vim and packages.vim directly.\n\nIf the README is not elaborate, sorry for that, space-vim now is in the early stages and a ton of stuff are waiting to be done.\n\n\n\nThe modular design is originally from .

The code will automatically detect if either of these is installed and call the appropriate kernel.\n\n\nThis version is faster but requires manual compilation for each machine environment.\nRun `python setup.py install` from the directory `extensions/kernels/`.\n\n\nThis version is provided by the .\nInstallation usually works out of the box with `pip install pykeops cmake` which are also listed in the requirements file.\n\n\nSelf-contained files for the S4 layer and variants can be found in ,\nwhich includes instructions for calling the module.\n\nSee  for visualizations explaining some concepts behind HiPPO and Sis a self-contained training script for MNIST and CIFAR that imports the standalone S4 file. The default settings `python example.py` reaches 88% accuracy on sequential CIFAR with a very simple S4D model of 200k parameters.\nThis script can be used as an example for using S4 variants in external repositories.\n\n\nThis repository aims to provide a very flexible framework for training sequence models. Many models and datasets are supported.\n\nThe basic entrypoint is `python -m train`, or equivalently\n\nwhich trains an S4 model on the Permuted MNIST dataset.\nThis should get to around 90% after 1 epoch which takes 1-3 minutes depending on GPU.\n\nMore examples of using this repository are documented throughout. See  for an overview.\n\n\nOne important feature of this codebase is supporting parameters that require different optimizer hyperparameters.\nIn particular, the SSM kernel is particularly sensitive to the $(A, B)$ (and sometimes $\\Delta$ parameters),\nso the learning rate on these parameters is sometimes lowered and the weight decay is always set to $0$.\n\nSee the method `register` in the model (e.g. ) and the function `setup_optimizer` in the training script (e.g. ) for an examples of how to implement this in external repos.\n\n<!-Our logic for setting these parameters can be found in the `OptimModule` class under `src/models/sequence/ss/kernel.py` and the corresponding optimizer hook in `SequenceLightningModule.configure_optimizers` under `train.py`\n-->\n\n\nThe core training infrastructure of this repository is based on  with a configuration scheme based on .\n\nThe main entrypoint is `train.py` and configs are found in `configs/`.\n\n\nBasic datasets are auto-downloaded, including MNIST, CIFAR, and Speech Commands.\nAll logic for creating and loading datasets is in  directory.\nThe README inside this subdirectory documents how to download and organize other datasets.\n\n\nModels are defined in .

Checkpoints will be saved here inside this folder and printed to console whenever a new checkpoint is created.\nTo resume training, simply point to the desired `.ckpt` file (a PyTorch Lightning checkpoint, e.g. `./outputs/<date>/<time>/checkpoints/val/loss.ckpt`) and append the flag `train.ckpt=<path>/<to>/<checkpoint>.ckpt` to the original training command.\n\n\nThe PTL  class controls the overall training loop and also provides many useful pre-defined flags. Some useful examples are explained below.\nThe full list of allowable flags can be found in the PTL documentation, as well as our . See the default trainer config  for the most useful options.\n\n\nSimply pass in `trainer.gpus=2` to train with 2 GPUs.\n\n\n`trainer.weights_summary=full` prints out every layer of the model with their parameter counts. Useful for debugging internals of models.\n\n\n`trainer.limit_{train,val}_batches={10,0.1}` trains (validates) on only 10 batches (0.1 fraction of all batches). Useful for testing the train loop without going through all the data.\n\n\nLogging with  is built into this repository.\nIn order to use this, simply set your `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable, and change the `wandb.project` attribute of  (or pass it on the command line e.g. `python -m train .... wandb.project=s4`).\n\nSet `wandb=null` to turn off WandB logging.\n\n\nAutoregressive generation can be performed with the  script.\nThis script can be used in two ways after training a model using this codebase.\n\n\nThe more flexible option requires the checkpoint path of the trained PyTorch Lightning model.\nThe generation script accepts the same config options as the train script, with a few additional flags that are documented in .\nAfter training with `python -m train <train flags>`, generate with\n\nAny of the flags found in the config can be overridden.\n\nNote: This option can be used with either `.ckpt` checkpoints (PyTorch Lightning, which includes information for the Trainer) or `.pt` checkpoints (PyTorch, which is just a model state dict).\n\n\nThe second option for generation does not require passing in training flags again, and instead reads the config from the Hydra experiment folder, along with a PyTorch Lightning checkpoint within the experiment folder.\n\n\n\nDownload the , for example to `./checkpoints/s4-wt103.pt`.\nThis model was trained with the command `python -m train experiment=lm/s4-wt103`.

We can also reduce the number of training and validation batches to get a checkpoint faster:\n\n\nAfter the first epoch completes, a message is printed indicating where the checkpoint is saved.\n\n\nOption 1:\n\nThis option redefines the full config so that the model and dataset can be constructed.\n\nOption 2:\n\nThis option only needs the path to the Hydra experiment folder and the desired checkpoint within.\n\n\n\nIf you use this codebase, or otherwise found our work valuable, please cite S4 and .\""

For spaces, models, and more, see the documentation.\n\n**Flexible data definition**: Use models to define data with complex types, collections, and more\n\n**Powerful querying with BlueQL**: A modern query language based on SQL\n\n**Rich data modeling**: Use `model`s to define data with complex types, collections, and more\n\n**Performant**: Heavily multithreaded, optimized write batching, and more\n\n**Secure**: BlueQL is designed to strongly deter query injection pathways\n\n**Enforces best practices**: If you're building with Skytable today, the practices you'll learn here will let you easily take on the job of building performant systems, even outside Skytable.\n\nTo set up Skytable on your machine:\n\n1. Download a bundled release file.\n2. Unzip the files and you're ready to go.\n3. Start the database server: `./skyd --auth-root-password <password>` with your choice of a password for the `root` account. The `root` account is just like a `root` account on Unix-based systems that has control over everything.\n4. Start the interactive client REPL: `./skysh` and then enter your password.\n5. You're ready to run queries!\n\n> For a more detailed guide on installation and deployment, see the documentation.\n\n**With the REPL started, follow this guide**:\n\n- Create a `space` and switch to it.\n- Create a `model`.\n- Insert some data.\n- Update some data.\n- Select some data.\n- Poke around!\n\n**For a complete guide on Skytable, its architecture, BlueQL, queries, and more, see the documentation**.\n\nWhile you're seeing \""

Supports touch events for mobile devices.\n\nAdd meny.js file to your project. The meny.js file is the only thing required, but you could optionally clone the repository if you want to get the default styles. Alternatively you can load the meny.js file from cdnjs, see https://cdnjs.com/libraries/meny.\n\n\nMeny requires two HTML elements to work: a menu and the page contents. The class names are not used by the library so choose anything you want.\n\n\n\nSome rules, notes and best practices to keep in mind in terms of markup and styling:\nThe menu and contents should have the same parent element. The background which appears behind the contents when Meny is open is not added by the library. You need to set your desired background to the parent element. The default style can be found in. The arrow which appears when Meny is closed is also not added by the library, if you want it you can easily copy the styles from the demo.css. The menu container will be automatically resized by the library according to configuration options. Meny works on scrolling pages as the menu itself is fixed.\n\n\n\nNext you need create an instance of Meny and tell it which HTML elements to use. This should be done after the meny.min.js is included on your page. Example using the HTML above:\n\n\n\nA few handy methods API methods are included, you call these on the instance returned by (see above).\n\n\n\nThe wrapper element (parent of the menu and contents) is decorated with classes based on its state:\n\n\n\nInstances of Meny dispatch events to notify you of their state:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdds opened and closed events\nAdds destroy API method\n\n\nAdd and config options\nFix error with tap to close when meny is on the left\nAdd API method for changing settings at runtime\n\n\nImprovements to touch interaction\nSetting threshold to 0 disables hover/touch-to-open\n\n\nInstances of Meny now dispatch 'open'/'close' events\n\n\n2D animation fallback (works in IE8+)\n\n\nRewrote the JavaScript\nAll core styles/transforms are set via JavaScript\nMade many options available at initialization\nNew JavaScript fallback using internal animation method\n\n\nFallback mode that doesn't rely on transforms\n\n\nCleaned up CSS\nFix bug where original events for taps on anchors were blocked\nIt's now possible to reach the meny via tapping as well as swiping\n\n\nInitial release\n\n\n\nMIT licensed\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Hakim El Hattab, http://hakim.se\""

Support requests, feature requests, and general questions should be submitted as a support request via Google Cloud support channels or via GitHub.\n\nCloud Storage FUSE is open source software, released under the .\n\nCloud Storage FUSE V2 provides important stability, functionality, and performance enhancements, including the introduction of a file cache that allows repeat file reads to be served from a local, faster cache storage of choice, such as a Local SSD, Persistent Disk, or even in-memory /tmpfs. The Cloud Storage FUSE file cache makes AI/ML training faster and more cost-effective by reducing the time spent waiting for data, with up to 2.3x faster training time and 3.4x higher throughput observed in training runs. This is especially valuable for multi epoch training and can serve small and random I/O operations significantly faster. The file cache feature is disabled by default and is enabled by passing a directory to 'cache-dir'. See  for more details.\n\nCloud Storage FUSE is an open source FUSE adapter that lets you mount and access Cloud Storage buckets as local file systems.

GANs can generate random photo-realistic images from random noise vectors in the latent space (see stunning examples of the Nvidia's), but we can no control over the features of the generated images.\n\nKnowing that the images are determined by the noise vector in the latent space, if we can understand the latent space, we can control our generation process. For a already well-trained GAN generator, I made its latent space transparent by discovering feature axes in it. When a vector moves along a feature axis in the latent space, the corresponding image morphs along that feature, which enables controlled synthesis and edit.\n\nThis is achieved by leveraging a coupled feature extractor network (a CNN here in this demo, but can be any other CV techniques), which enables us to find correlation between noise vectors and image features.\n\nAdvantages of this method over conditional GAN and AC-GAN:\n    Efficiency: To add a new controller of the generator, you do not have to re-train the GAN model, thus it only takes <1h to add 40 knobs with out methods.\n    Flexibility: You could use different feature extractors trained on different dataset and add knobs to the well-trained GAN\n\nI host the demo as a Kaggle notebook instead of a more convenient web app due to cost considerations.\n\nKaggle generously provides kernels with GPUs for Free! Alternatively, a web app with a backend running on an AWS GPU instance costs ~$600 per month. Thanks to Kaggle that makes it possible for everyone to play with the model without downloading code/data to your local machine!\n\nOpen this link from your web browser: https://www.kaggle.com/summitkwan/tl-gan-demo\n\nMake sure you have a Kaggle account.

To have a Kaggle account is actually very rewarding, since allows you to participate numerous data science challenges and join the knowledgeable and friendly community.\n\nFork the current notebook\nrun the notebook by pressing the double right arrow button at the bottom left of the web page.

Displayed on-screen, is some information about your target (Earth), your speed, and the current time (Universal Time, so it'll probably be a few hours off from your computer's clock). Right drag the mouse to orbit Earth and you might see the Moon and some familiar constellations. Left dragging the mouse changes your orientation also, but the camera rotates about its center instead of rotating around Earth. Rolling the mouse wheel will change your distance to Earth--you can move light years away, then roll the wheel in the opposite direction to get back to your starting location. If your mouse lacks a wheel, you can use the Home and End keys instead. When running Celestia, you will usually have some object selected. Currently, it's Earth, but it could also be a star, moon, spacecraft, galaxy, or some other object. The simplest way to select an object is to click on it. Try clicking on a star to select it. The information about Earth is replaced with some details about the star. Press G (or use the Navigation menu), and you'll zoom through space toward the selected star. If you press G again, you'll approach the star even closer. Press H to select our Sun, and then G to go back to our Sun. Right click on the sun to bring up a menu of planets and other objects in the solar system. After selecting a planet from the menu, hit G again to travel toward it. Once there, hold down the right mouse button and drag to orbit the planet. The Tour Guide is a list of some of the more interesting objects you can visit in Celestia. Select the Tour Guide option in the Navigation menu to display the Tour Guide window. Choose a destination from the list, click the Goto button, and you're off. That covers the very basics. For a more in-depth look at Celestia and the controls available to you, download the \"Celestia User's Guide\" (written by Frank Gregorio), available in several languages, from: https://celestiaproject.space/guides.html This web page also includes links to the Celestia README file translated into Japanese. By default, the Star Browser window displays a table of the 100 nearest stars, along with their Distance, Apparent and Absolute Magnitude, and Type. Clicking on the column headers will sort the stars. The table is not continuously updated, so if you travel to another star, you should press the Refresh button to update the table for your current position. The radio buttons beneath the table let you switch between viewing a list of Nearest, Brightest, or 'With planets' stars. As with the solar system browser, clicking on any star name in the table will select it. Use this feature along with the Center and Go To buttons to tour the stars visible from any night sky in the galaxy. The Solar System Browser displays a window with a tree view of all the objects in the nearest solar system (if there is one within a light year of your current position.) Clicking on the name of any object in the window will select it. You can then use the Center or Go To buttons to display that object in the main Celestia window. Celestia provides several ways to select an object by name... Choose 'Select Object' from the Navigation menu, type in the object name, and click OK. Press Enter, type in the entire object name, and press Enter again. Press Enter, type in the first few characters of the object name, press the Tab key to move through the displayed listing until the object is highlighted, then press Enter again. You can use common names, Bayer designations or catalog numbers for stars. Celestia currently supports the HIP, HD and SAO catalogs. Catalog numbers must be entered with a space between the prefix and the catalog number. For up-to-the-minute answers to some common problems encountered when running Celestia, please view either the FAQ in the Help menu or take a look at the \"Celestia User's FAQ\" located on the Celestia User's Forum: https://celestiaproject.space/forum/ You can modify how Celestia starts up each time you run it, by defining your own start-up settings. Simply open the file \"start.cel\" in a plain text editor and follow the in-file instructions. Also, view the celestia.cfg file in a plain text editor to see additional settings. Celestia allows you to easily add real, hypothetical, or fictional objects by creating new catalog files. It is *not recommended that you alter the built-in data files; nearly all desired modifications and additions can be made by placing new catalog files in Celestia's extras folders. There are three types of catalog files: ssc (solar system catalog: planets, moons, spacecraft, etc.) stc (star catalog) dsc (deep sky catalog: galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae) All three types of catalog file are text files that can be updated with your favorite text editing program.

Pressing `<C-Space>` opens a window listing Buffers, Files, Tabs, Workspaces, or Bookmarks selectable by the `j`, `k`, and `<CR>` keys.\n\nIf you have already starred this repo, thank you! If you have a question, a feature request, or a new idea, then don't hesitate to post new issues or pull requests: Collaboration is the most awesome thing in the open source community!\n\nThese Lists can be explained with a simple analogy: Imagine Vim is a writing desk. The Bookmarks List lists your favorite projects that are like drawers. To look up the documents in a drawer you need the File List. Once you locate and pick up a file it becomes a buffer. A buffer is like a sheet of paper lying on the desk. Sometimes you can have a blank piece of paper --that's a new unsaved buffer. Eventually, once saved (put into a drawer), it becomes a file. The Buffer List lets you manage all papers on the desk. The strongest point of Vim-CtrlSpace is its handling of Tab pages: Each tab holds a separate list of buffers; like a pile of documents on the desk. With tabs you can, for example: group related buffers, extract to other tabs, name them accordingly, move or copy them. Tabs can be accessed and managed within Tab List. All your buffers, tabs, and tab layouts can be persisted as a workspace. It's like taking a picture of your desk with an instant camera. You can save multiple workspaces per project with the Workspace List.\n\nIf you use , then add to your `vimrc` file (whose path is shown by `:help vimrc`):\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceUseTabline = 0\n```\n\nYou can also clone the repository to your `vimfiles` directory (whose path is shown by `:help vimrc`):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace.git ~/.vim/vimfiles\n```\n\nFirst please make sure that you set `nocompatible` and `hidden` options, and set `encoding=utf-8` (as required by the plugin) in your `.vimrc`:\n\n```\nset nocompatible\nset hidden\nset encoding=utf-8\n```\n\nIf you feel brave enough turn off tabline:\n\nTabline in Vim has very limited capabilities and as Vim-CtrlSpace makes use of tabs intensively, tabline would just get in your way. Tab List(`<l>`) makes tabline obsolete ;).\n\nNeovim requires adding the following line to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`:\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceUseTabline = 0\n```\n\nNote the trailing space at the end of the mapping. Neovim doesn't mind it, but it makes vim-ctrlspace's \"is the mapping left at default\" check fail so it won't change the mapping to `<nul>`.\n\nAlright! You've hopefully installed, configured Vim-CtrlSpace, and restarted Vim (otherwise do it!). Now you're wondering how to start using this thing.\n\nFirst, you need to select a project. Vim operates in a directory, described as CWD (Current Working Directory). If you've just started a MacVim it's probably pointing to your home directory (issue `:pwd` to check it).\n\nI advise you to add a project to the Bookmark List by opening the plugin window (`<C-Space>`) and pressing `<b>`. The plugin will ask for a project directory.\n\nMake sure that the path is not your home directory. Otherwise the plugin will start indexing all your files which will be pointless and resource exhaustive. Be concrete and provide a real path to a project. Once your bookmark is created, you can go there with `<CR>`.\n\nNow open some files with `<o>`. Finally save a workspace with `<w>` by providing your first workspace name.\n\nFor more information please check out Vim-CtrlSpace help directly in Vim:\n\nFor key reference press `<?>` inside the plugin window.\n\nIf you are used to hitting the `<ctrl-P>` key combination for fuzzy search, add this to your .vimrc file:\n\n```\nnnoremap <C-P> :CtrlSpaceFind<CR>\n```\n\nBe sure to remember to refresh your search file list using `<r>` command.\n\nCtrl-Space can automatically save your workspace status based on configurations below:\n\nThe plugin provides engine compiled for popular operating systems and architectures. By default it will attempt to detect your OS and architecture. To see if auto detection was successful press `<?>`.\n\nTo speed up the startup of Vim, replace it by a custom simpler one that restricts to those architectures most probably used by you, and does not involve system calls. For example, if you use , then by adding to your `vimrc`:\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceFileEngine = 'ripgrep'\n```\n\nThe file engine binaries have been compiled for various OS's and CPU types, but only those for Linux, MacOS and Windows on 64 bit architectures are available in the git repository. The other versions for their 32 bit architecture counterparts, as well as for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD on `ARM`, `MIPS`, `amd64` and `32` bit architectures can be downloaded at:\n\n```\nhttps://git.io/vim-ctrlspace-release-all_os_file_engines\n```\n\nTo find more about setting up the file engines, check:\n\nLastly, this file engine sources the list of files it searches through from a text file cache (`cs_files`, typically stored under `.git/`). For small to medium-sized projects (say <1k files as a cautious estimate), where loading from this files cache isn't likely to yield a noticeable speed boost, and you might instead rather not think about when to refresh the cache (for instance on switching to a branch with different files), you may disable the cache and by extension forgo using the Go file engine by setting the option below:\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceDisableFileEngine = 1\n```\n\nVim-Ctrlspace displays icons in the UI if your font supports UTF8, or ASCII characters as a fallback. Some symbols (glyphs) might not look well with the font you are using, so feel free to change and adjust them.\n\nI use the following symbols of the Inconsolata font in MacVim:\n\nSince it's impossible to provide universal character set that would look well on any machine, the fine tuning is left to you.\n\nYou can find more about this tuning option in the plugin help:\n\nIf you feel that you have found a better symbol for a given view, you are more than welcome to open a pull request.\n\nAnother important setting is the Globcommand that collects all files in your project directory. The Glob commands `rg`, `fd` and `ag` respect `.gitignore` rules (where `ag` does not support the re-inclusion prefix `!` that re-includes files excluded by a previous exclusion pattern) and are faster (in the given order as showed a coarse benchmark on Linux) than that built-in. They can be used by adding the following lines to `vimrc`:\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceGlobCommand = 'rg'\n```\n\nIf your projects have more than 100 000 files, then you can make the file search more responsive by increasing the plugin's fuzzy search delay timing value:\n\n```\nlet g:CtrlSpaceFuzzySearchDelay = 200\n```\n\nFinally, you can adjust some plugin colors. By default plugin uses the following setup:\n\nHowever some color schemes show search results with the same colors as PMenu groups. If that's your case try to link CtrlSpaceSearch highlight group to IncSearch instead:\n\n```\nhighlight CtrlSpaceSearch ctermfg=Black ctermbg=White cterm=Reverse\n```\n\nOf course nothing prevents you from providing your own highlighting, for example:\n\n```\nhighlight CtrlSpaceSearch ctermfg=Blue ctermbg=Black cterm=Bold\n```\n\nCopyright © 2013-2020 Szymon Wrozynski and Contributors.

I would like to thank Daryl Bennett for his years of work in taking over maintenance of this project.\n\nA Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows for volatile memory acquisition from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as Android. This makes LiME unique as it is the first tool that allows for full memory captures on Android devices. It also minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes during acquisition, which allows it to produce memory captures that are more forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux memory acquisition.\n\nFull Android memory acquisition\nAcquisition over network interface\nMinimal process footprint\nHash of dumped memory\n\nDetailed documentation on LiME's usage and internals can be found in the \"doc\" directory of the project.\n\nLiME utilizes the insmod command to load the module, passing required arguments for its execution.\n\nIn this example we use adb to load LiME and then start it with acquisition performed over the network\n\nNow on the host machine, we can establish the connection and acquire memory using netcat\n\nAcquiring to sdcard\n\nReally LiME will support any digest algorithm that the kernel library can.\nCollecting a digest file when dumping over tcp will require 2 separate connections.\n\nFor a quick reference here is a list of supported digests.\n\nCompression can reduce significantly the time required to acquire a memory capture. It can achieve the speedup of 4x over uncompressed transfers with a few memory overhead (~ 24 KB).\n\nThe RAM file will be in the zlib format, which is different from the gzip or zip formats. The reason is that the deflate library embedded in the kernel do not support them.\n\nTo decompress it you can use  or any zlib-compatible library.\n\nNote that only the RAM file is compressed. The digest file is not compressed, and the hash value will match the uncompressed data.\n\nLiME was first presented at Shmoocon 2012 by Joe Sylve.\nYoutube~ Android Mind Reading: Memory Acquisition and Analysis with DMD and Volatility\""

But we're not afraid...space flights can't be stopped.\n― Yuri Gagarin\n\nSo far, not much. Only a very limited subset of CSS is currently supported, so most web pages will not work. However, given very basic HTML and CSS, Kosmonaut does render the right things — see Kosmonaut's rendering of , compared with that of Firefox:\n\nHere is a summary of things Kosmonaut can do, things I'm currently working on, and things that are towards the front of the todo list.\n\n[x] Parse HTML and small subset of CSS into DOM and rules, cascade CSS and apply to DOM\n[x] Layout and paint of normal flow, non-replaced block-level boxes.\n    </sup> for  with `writing-mode` and `direction` properties\nand \n[x] Support for arbitrary scale factors (e.g. high-DPI monitors)\n[x] Text rendering (without actual integration into layout — see next item)\n[ ] Layout of basic non-replaced inline-level content (such as text)\n\n<b id=\"f1\">1:</b> Orthogonal flows () not supported. \nMixed `writing-mode` support in general (including parallel flows) is currently iffy — I recommend simply using `{ writing-mode: <val> }`. \n\nKosmonaut was created with the intention of learning browser engine development. However, the project has come a little ways now, and I've been thinking about niches I can work towards fitting Kosmonaut into. I've shared some thoughts on potential niches , and would love to hear your ideas too.\n\nKosmonaut is built with Rust using OpenGL bindings via , for window management and OpenGL context creation, Servo's  and  for HTML and CSS parsing, and various other auxiliary libraries.\n\nTo build from source:\n\nInstall Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\nInstall native dependencies, most of which are required for FreeType which Kosmonaut uses for text rendering.\n    Windows 10, MacOS\n        Skip this step (Kosmonaut uses , which uses the native font APIs for Windows and MacOS).\n    Ubuntu\n        Install the dependencies found in  on your machine (the `apt-get install` bit).\n    Arch Linux \n        Install the dependencies found in  on your machine (the `pacman -Syu` bit).\n    For those running on other operating systems, you'll need to install the equivalent packages. I'd love to get more documentation on installation for other systems, so open an issue if you have trouble or if you'd like to share your setup process.\n`cargo build`\n\nTo render HTML and CSS with Kosmonaut, either pass files (HTML and optionally CSS):\n\n`cargo run -tests/websrc/rainbow-divs.html`\n\nor a URL:\n\n`cargo run -https://twilco.github.io/assets/html/rainbow-divs.html`\n\nTo run the tests, both unit and layout, execute:\n\n`cargo test --all`\n\nFor layout tests, Kosmonaut transforms the given HTML and CSS into a box tree, lays it out, and dumps it as text. Those text snapshots are verified with .\n\nIf you need to review / update layout snapshots, it is helpful to install the Cargo insta CLI tool like so:\n\n`cargo install cargo-insta`\n\nKosmonaut can also run ref-tests. Ref-tests render two HTML files and compares the result pixel-by-pixel, ensuring they are the same. This is useful in lots of scenarios, such as testing that shorthands render the same as their longhand equivalents.\n\nKosmonaut's current implementation is heavily inspired by , sometimes taking code directly from it. Thus, Kosmonaut is licensed with the .\n\nKosmonaut also takes inspiration from . Thanks to  for their great series of articles on browser engines.\n\nFinally, Kosomonaut's DOM implementation was taken from  and has been slightly modified to fit our needs.\""

Its playground is our solar system with many of its major bodies – the sun, planets and moons. You take control of a spacecraft – either historic, hypothetical, or purely science fiction. Orbiter is unlike most commercial computer games with a space theme – there are no predefined missions to complete (except the ones you set yourself), no aliens to destroy and no goods to trade. Instead, you will get a pretty good idea about what is involved in real space flight – how to plan an ascent into orbit, how to rendezvous with a space station, or how to fly to another planet. It is more difficult, but also more of a challenge. Some people get hooked, others get bored. Finding out for yourself is easy – simply give it a try. Orbiter is free, so you don’t need to invest more than a bit of your spare time.\n\nOrbiter is now published as an Open Source project under the MIT License (see file for details).\n\nD3D9Client graphics engine is licensed under LGPL, see\n\n|  | Minimum requirements | Recommended requirements |\n| ---| ---| ---|\n| RAM: | 4GB | 8GB |\n| CPU: | Dual Core |  |\n| GPU: | 200 GFlops | 500 GFlops |\n| Disk: | 5GB of free space | 10GB of free space (80GB if you want hi-res textures) |\n\nGet the Orbiter source repository from github\n\nor\n\nTo configure and generate the makefiles, you need a recent\n\nTo compile Orbiter from its sources, you need\nOrbiter has been successfully built with VS Community 2019, but other versions should also work. Note that VS2019 comes with built-in CMake support, so you don't need a separate CMake installation.\n\nSome configuration caveats:\nIf you are using the\ngenerator (default for the VS built-in CMake), you may also need to configure the VS toolset.\nIf you are using the VS2019 generator, you may need to set up Visual Studio to use only a single thread for the build. This is because some of the build tools (especially those for generating the Orbiter documentation) are not threadsafe, and the VS2019 generator doesn't understand the CMake JOB_POOL directive.\n\nOrbiter is a 32-bit application. Be sure to configure vspkg and CMake accordingly.\n\nIf you want to build the documentation, you need a few additional tools:\na filter to convert ODT and DOC sources to PDF, such as\na LaTeX compiler suite such as\nfor building the source-level\ndocumentation for developers.\n\nBy default, the build is configured to create both graphics flavours of the Orbiter executable (although this can be configured with the ORBITER_GRAPHICS CMake flag):\n``orbiter.exe`` is the standalone Orbiter application with built-in DX7 graphics.\n``orbiter_ng.exe`` is a launcher for ``./Modules/Server/orbiter.exe`` which is the graphics server version of Orbiter. It requires an external graphics client plugin to be loaded via the Modules tab of the Orbiter Launchpad dialog.\nThe reference D3D7Client is included with the build with essentially the same functionality as the built-in graphics version. Use 3rd party client implementations to make use of more modern graphics engines.\n\nSee\nfor details on building Orbiter.\n\nThe Orbiter git repository does not include most of the planetary texture files required for running Orbiter.\nYou need to install those separately. The easiest way to do so is by installing\nOptionally you can also install high-resolution versions of the textures from the Orbiter website.\nYou should keep the Orbiter 2016 installation separate from your Orbiter git repository.\n\nTo configure Orbiter to use the 2016 texture installation, set the\nORBITER_PLANET_TEXTURE_INSTALL_DIR entry in CMake. For example, if Orbiter 2016 was installed in `C:\\Orbiter2016`, the CMake option should be set to\n`C:/Orbiter2016/Textures`.\nAlternatively, you can configure the texture directory after building Orbiter by setting the `PlanetTexDir` entry in `Orbiter.cfg`.\n\nHelp files are located in the Doc subfolder (if you built them). Orbiter.pdf is the main Orbiter user manual.\n\nThe in-game help system can be opened via the \"Help\" button on the Orbiter Launchpad dialog, or with Alt-F1 while running Orbiter.\n\nRemaining questions can be posted on the Orbiter user forum at\n.\""

This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to simplify and modernize the codebase.\n\nThe original description was very apt, so I'll include it here:\n\n> Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for. This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both inside and outside a corporate network. Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks that leak internal address space. That's especially useful in targeted malware.\n\n\nOR\n\n\nLet's start with something basic:\n\nTraverse IPs near discovered domains to search for contiguous blocks with the --traverse flag:\n\nLimit nearby IP traversal to certain domains with the --search flag:\n\nAttempt an HTTP connection on domains discovered with the --connect flag:\n\nExchange speed for breadth with the --wide flag, which looks for nearby domains on all IPs of the of a discovered domain:\n\nZone transfers are rare these days, but they give us the keys to the DNS castle. is a very useful service for testing for and learning about zone transfers:\n\nTo save the results to a file for later use we can simply redirect output:\n\nInternal networks will often have large blocks of contiguous IP space assigned. We can scan those as well:\n\nCheck out --help for further information:\n\n\nFirst, install  and development packages:\""

results from the paper\n.\n\nYou can find detailed usage instructions for training your own models and using pretrained models below.\n\nIf you find our code or paper useful, please consider citing\n\n    @inproceedings{Occupancy Networks,\n        title = {Occupancy Networks: Learning 3D Reconstruction in Function Space},\n        author = {Mescheder, Lars and Oechsle, Michael and Niemeyer, Michael and Nowozin, Sebastian and Geiger, Andreas},\n        booktitle = {Proceedings IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n        year = {2019}\n    }\n\n\nFirst you have to make sure that you have all dependencies in place.\nThe simplest way to do so, is to use . \n\nYou can create an anaconda environment called `mesh_funcspace` using\n\n\nNext, compile the extension modules.\nYou can do this via\n\n\nTo compile the dmc extension, you have to have a cuda enabled device set up.\nIf you experience any errors, you can simply comment out the `dmc_*` dependencies in `setup.py`.\nYou should then also comment out the `dmc` imports in `im2mesh/config.py`.\n\n\n\nYou can now test our code on the provided input images in the `demo` folder.\nTo this end, simply run\n\nThis script should create a folder `demo/generation` where the output meshes are stored.\nThe script will copy the inputs into the `demo/generation/inputs` folder and creates the meshes in the `demo/generation/meshes` folder.\nMoreover, the script creates a `demo/generation/vis` folder where both inputs and outputs are copied together.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate a pretrained model or train a new model from scratch, you have to obtain the dataset.\nTo this end, there are two options:\n\nyou can download our preprocessed data\nyou can download the ShapeNet dataset and run the preprocessing pipeline yourself\n\nTake in mind that running the preprocessing pipeline yourself requires a substantial amount time and space on your hard drive.\nUnless you want to apply our method to a new dataset, we therefore recommmend to use the first option.\n\n\nYou can download our preprocessed data (73.4 GB) using\n\n\n\nThis script should download and unpack the data automatically into the `data/ShapeNet` folder.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also preprocess the dataset yourself.\nTo this end, you have to follow the following steps:\ndownload the  and put into `data/external/ShapeNet`. \ndownload the  from Choy et al. 2016 and unpack them in `data/external/Choy2016` \nbuild our modified version of  by following the instructions in the `external/mesh-fusion` folder\n\nYou are now ready to build the dataset:\n \n\nThis command will build the dataset in `data/ShapeNet.build`.\nTo install the dataset, run\n\n\nIf everything worked out, this will copy the dataset into `data/ShapeNet`.\n\n\nWhen you have installed all binary dependencies and obtained the preprocessed data, you are ready to run our pretrained models and train new models from scratch.\n\n\nTo generate meshes using a trained model, use\n\nwhere you replace `CONFIG.yaml` with the correct config file.\n\nThe easiest way is to use a pretrained model.\nYou can do this by using one of the config files\n\nwhich correspond to the experiments presented in the paper.\nOur script will automatically download the model checkpoints and run the generation.\nYou can find the outputs in the `out/*/*/pretrained` folders.\n\nPlease note that the config files  `*_pretrained.yaml` are only for generation, not for training new models: when these configs are used for training, the model will be trained from scratch, but during inference our code will still use the pretrained model.\n\n\nFor evaluation of the models, we provide two scripts: `eval.py` and `eval_meshes.py`.\n\nThe main evaluation script is `eval_meshes.py`.\nYou can run it using\n\nThe script takes the meshes generated in the previous step and evaluates them using a standardized protocol.\nThe output will be written to `.pkl`/`.csv` files in the corresponding generation folder which can be processed using .\n\nFor a quick evaluation, you can also run\n\nThis script will run a fast method specific evaluation to obtain some basic quantities that can be easily computed without extracting the meshes.\nThis evaluation will also be conducted automatically on the validation set during training.\n\nAll results reported in the paper were obtained using the `eval_meshes.py` script.\n\n\nFinally, to train a new network from scratch, run\n\nwhere you replace `CONFIG.yaml` with the name of the configuration file you want to use.\n\nYou can monitor on <http://localhost:6006> the training process using :\n\nwhere you replace `OUTPUT_DIR` with the respective output directory.\n\nFor available training options, please take a look at `configs/default.yaml`.\n\n\nIn our paper we used random crops and scaling to augment the input images. \n  However, we later found that this image augmentation decreases performance on the ShapeNet test set.\n  The pretrained model that is loaded in `configs/img/onet_pretrained.yaml` was hence trained without data augmentation and has slightly better performance than the model from the paper. The updated table looks a follows:\n  \n  For completeness, we also provide the trained weights for the model which was used in the paper in  `configs/img/onet_legacy_pretrained.yaml`.\nNote that training and evaluation of both our model and the baselines is performed with respect to the *watertight models*, but that normalization into the unit cube is performed with respect to the *non-watertight meshes(to be consistent with the voxelizations from Choy et al.). As a result, the bounding box of the sampled point cloud is usually slightly bigger than the unit cube and may differ a little bit from a point cloud that was sampled from the original ShapeNet mesh.\n\n\nPlease also check out the following concurrent papers that have proposed similar ideas:\""

Do not try to use it, it likely does not work anymore.**\n\nCarte Blanche is an isolated development space with integrated fuzz testing for your components. See them individually, explore them in different states and quickly and confidently develop them.\n\n**Please note that this project is in a beta state and under heavy development. We encourage you to try it out on your projects and letting us know of any issues you run into!** In addition we haven't invested time to make it work on windows yet. Let us know in case you want to help. `react@^15.0.0` is required\n\nSetting up Carte Blanche is an easy two-step process:\n\nInstall the plugin with `npm install --save-dev carte-blanche`\n\nAdd it to the plugins in your development webpack configuration, specifying a relative path to the folder with your components in the `componentRoot` option:\n\n```\nThat's it, now start your development environment and go to /carte-blanche to see your Carte Blanche!\n```\n\nYou can specify some options for the webpack plugin:\n\n- `componentRoot` (required): Folder where your component modules are.\n\n- `dest` (default: `'carte-blanche'`): Change the location of your Carte Blanche. Needs to be a path.\n\n- `plugins` (default: `ReactPlugin`): An array of plugins to use in your Carte Blanche. *(Want to write your own? See [Plugin Development](https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/docs/plugin-development.md) for more information!)*\n\n- `filter` (default: matches files that start with a capital letter and/or folders that start with a capital letter and contain an index file): Regex that matches your components in the `componentRoot` folder. *We do not recommend changing this, as it might have unintended side effects.*\n\n- `hot`: The tool tries to auto detect if you use HotReloading in your application. In any case if you don't have HotReloading we recommend to deactivate it with this option. Set it to true in case to force Carte Blanche to include it.\n\n- `variationFolderName` (default: `variations`): The name of the folders that stores the variation files.\n\n- `port` (default: 8082): The port the variations server runs at.\n\n- `hostname` (default: `localhost`): The URL the variations server runs at.\n\n- `injectTags` (default: empty Array): Injects these tags into the iFrames of the rendered components. Useful for webfonts, stylesheets, etc. \n  Example usage: [https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/examples/users/webpack.dev.babel.js](https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/examples/users/webpack.dev.babel.js)\n\n- `files` (default: empty Array): Users can add custom .js and .css files to the iFrame with the files option.\n  Example usage: [https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/examples/redux/todomvc/webpack.config.babel.js](https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/examples/redux/todomvc/webpack.config.babel.js)\n\nThis is a list of endorsed plugins that are useable right now:\n\n- : CarteBlanche React = ❤︎ (installed if no other plugins are specified)\n- Show the source code of your components right in the interface!\n\nWant to write your own plugin? Check out [Plugin Development](https://github.com/carteb/carte-blanche/blob/master/docs/plugin-development.md)!\n\nExamples are in the `examples` directory. To run them, first run the command `npm run examples:directory`, where `directory` is the path to the example, with each directory separated by `:`.\n\nFor example, to run the Redux TodoMVC example, run `npm run example:redux:todomvc`.\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Nikolaus Graf and Maximilian Stoiber, licensed under the MIT License.\""

Explore dozens, hundreds,\nor even thousands of systems in a galaxy of your choosing, expand across its\nplanets, exploit the resources you find, and ultimately exterminate any who\nstand in your way. The fate of your empire depends on your ability to master\nthe economy, field a military, influence galactic politics, and learn what you\ncan about the universe.\n\nThis repository contains the full source code needed to build Star Ruler 2, and\nall secondary scripts, data files and assets required to run it.\n\nBlind Mind Studios has been inactive for a few years now, so we decided to\nopen-source the game as a whole and allow anyone interested in how its engine works\nto tinker with it.\n\nThe Star Ruler 2.exe contained in the main folder is just a launcher. To run\nthe game you will need to build the binary for your platform from source.\n\nYou will need Visual Studio 2017 to build Star Ruler 2 on windows. Simply open the\nvisual studio solution in source/msvc/Star Ruler 2/, and build the \"Star Ruler 2\" project\nin either Debug or Non-Steam Release configuration.\n\nPlease note that while the built exe ends up in the bin/win64/ directory, it expects to be\nstarted with its working directory set to the main directory (where the\nlauncher exe is). So when debugging from visual studio, make sure the 'Working\nDirectory' configuration property is set to ../../..\n\nThe equivalent launcher on linux is StarRuler2.sh. To build the binary files on linux,\nmake sure your working directory is set to the main directory (the one with StarRuler2.sh in it),\nthen run `make -f source/linux/Makefile compile` to compile the binary.\n\nAfterward, run the `StarRuler2.sh` shell script to start the game.\n\nSeveral dependencies are required to build on linux, including libpng, zlib,\nGLEW, GLU, freetype2, libvorbisfile, libvorbis, libogg, libopenal, libbz2,\nlibXRandR, and libcurl.\n\nThe music is not part of the open source release of Star Ruler The data/music/ directory from the commercial\n  release can be copied directly into the data/ directory of an open-source build. The music will be detected and played.\nAll code for accessing the SteamWorks API has been removed. The game platform abstraction layer game\\_platform.h has \n  been kept intact, so other mod-sharing platforms could potentially be integrated into the game.\nCode for the automatic game patcher that is part of the GOG.com release is part of the repository, but the functionality\n  is disabled, since it relies on delta updates and will not work with modified open source versions.\nWhile the actual source code is probably still compatible with 32-bit platforms, project files and external dependencies for\n  32-bit builds are not included in this repository.\n\nYes. The base open source version is multiplayer-compatible with the commercial versions. If you make multiplayer-incompatible\nchanges to the open source version, please remember to change the MP\\_VERSION identifier in scripts/definitions/version.as,\nso things do not break from people with incompatible versions trying to join each other.\n\nYes. The code has been modified to bypass all DLC checks and unlock it by default. The Wake of the Heralds content\nis always available in the open-source version.\n\nMost Star Ruler 2 community activity is centered around the \n(it is possible to post without owning the game on steam), and the ,\none of the largest SR2 mod projects.\n\nStar Ruler 2 source code is licensed as MIT, art assets are licensed as CC-BY-NC 2.Some third party code is contained in this repository as dependencies.

We can also provide a custom transition override to the library from predefined transitions. (We can also create our own transitions from scratch, but we'll get to that later.)\n\n\n\nMultiple values are supported!\n\n\n\n\nIf we really want to get into detail, we can provide how we wish the frame to enter (first half of the frame duration) and exit (second half).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add your own transitions with the javascript\n<script src=\"space.js\"></script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tvar transitions = {\n\t\trotate720: {\n\t\t\t'rotate':{from:0, to:720}\n\t\t},\n\t\tfadeOutHalf: {\n\t\t\t'opacity':{from:1, to:0.5}\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\tSpace.addTransitions(transitions);\n</script>\n```\n\n\nNote that these might come to change during the beta-phase of the library.\n\nscaleIn\nfadeIn\nscaleOut\nfadeOut\nrotateQuarterRight\nrotateInQuarterClockwise\nzoomOut\nslideInBottom\nslideOutDown\nslideOutLeft\nslideOutRight\nslideInRight\nslideOutUp\nslideInTop\nslideInLeft\nslideBottomRight\nrotate360\nrotate3dOut\""

Rather, there is a collection of source code files, duplicating the code in the book. You can read and/or run whatever you like. Lisp is an interactive language, and you will need to interact with the code to get benefit from it. Some hints:\n\nYou will need a Common Lisp interpreter/compiler/environment. Here's a of the options.\nYou will always need `(load \"auxfns.lisp\")`.\nYou will need `(requires \"`*file*`\")`, for the various\ninstances of *filethat you want to use. (If `requires` does not work properly on\nyour system you may have to alter its definition, in \n`auxfns.lisp`.  \nThe function `do-examples`, which takes as an argument either `:all`\nor a chapter number or a list of chapter numbers, can be used to see examples\nof the use of various functions.  For example, `(do-examples 1)` shows\nthe examples from chapter Access this by doing `(requires \"examples\")`.\n\n\n\nI wrote a on the book in There is a nice  of the code, by Daniel Connelly at Georgia Tech, supervised by Ashok Goel.\""

(And some of the old code may live on there.)\n\nMycroft is a hackable open source voice assistant.\n\nFirst, get the code on your system!  The simplest method is via git:\n`cd ~`\n`git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core.git`\n`cd mycroft-core`\n`bash dev_setup.sh`\n\nThis script sets up dependencies and a [virtualenv].  If running in an environment besides Ubuntu/Debian, Arch or Fedora you may need to manually install packages as instructed by dev_setup.sh.\n\n[about-virtualenv]:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/\n\nNOTE: The default branch for this repository is 'dev', which should be considered a work-in-progress. If you want to clone a more stable version, switch over to the 'master' branch.\n\nMycroft provides `start-mycroft.sh` to perform common tasks. This script uses a virtualenv created by `dev_setup.sh`.  Assuming you installed mycroft-core in your home directory run:\n`cd ~/mycroft-core`\n`./start-mycroft.sh debug`\n\nThe \"debug\" command will start the background services (microphone listener, skill, messagebus, and audio subsystems) as well as bringing up a text-based Command Line Interface (CLI) you can use to interact with Mycroft and see the contents of the various logs. Alternatively you can run `./start-mycroft.sh all` to begin the services without the command line interface.  Later you can bring up the CLI using `./start-mycroft.sh cli`.\n\nThe background services can be stopped as a group with:\n`./stop-mycroft.sh`\n\nMycroft AI, Inc. maintains a device and account management system known as Mycroft Home. Developers may sign up at: https://home.mycroft.ai\n\nBy default, mycroft-core  is configured to use Home. By saying \"Hey Mycroft, pair my device\" (or any other request verbal request) you will be informed that your device needs to be paired. Mycroft will speak a 6-digit code which you can enter into the pairing page within the .\n\nOnce paired, your unit will use Mycroft API keys for services such as Speech-to-Text (STT), weather and various other skills.\n\nMycroft is nothing without skills.  There are a handful of default skills that are downloaded automatically to your `/opt/mycroft/skills` directory, but most need to be installed explicitly.  See the  to discover skills made by others.  Please share your own interesting work!\n\nPairing information generated by registering with Home is stored in:\n`~/.config/mycroft/identity/identity2.json` <-DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!\n\nMycroft's configuration consists of 4 possible locations:\n`mycroft-core/mycroft/configuration/mycroft.conf`(Defaults)\n(Remote)\n`/etc/mycroft/mycroft.conf` (Machine)\n`$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/mycroft/mycroft.conf` (which is by default `$HOME/.config/mycroft/mycroft.conf`) (USER)\n\nWhen the configuration loader starts, it looks in these locations in this order, and loads ALL configurations. Keys that exist in multiple configuration files will be overridden by the last file to contain the value. This process results in a minimal amount being written for a specific device and user, without modifying default distribution files.\n\nIf you do not wish to use the Mycroft Home service, before starting Mycroft for the first time, create `$HOME/.config/mycroft/mycroft.conf` with the following contents:\n\nThe Mycroft backend provides access to a range of API keys for specific services. Without pairing with the Mycroft backend, you will need to add your own API keys, install a different Skill or Plugin to perform that function, or not have access to that functionality.\n\nThese are the keys currently used in Mycroft Core through the Mycroft backend:\n\nare available for use with Mycroft.\nMany schools, universities and workplaces run a `proxy` on their network. If you need to type in a username and password to access the external internet, then you are likely behind a `proxy`.\n\nIf you plan to use Mycroft behind a proxy, then you will need to do an additional configuration step.\n\n_NOTE: In order to complete this step, you will need to know the `hostname` and `port` for the proxy server. Your network administrator will be able to provide these details. Your network administrator may want information on what type of traffic Mycroft will be using. We use `https` traffic on port `443`, primarily for accessing ReST-based APIs._\n\nIf you are using Mycroft behind a proxy without authentication, add the following environment variables, changing the `proxy_hostname.com` and `proxy_port` for the values for your network. These commands are executed from the Linux command line interface (CLI).\n\nIf  you are behind a proxy which requires authentication, add the following environment variables, changing the `proxy_hostname.com` and `proxy_port` for the values for your network. These commands are executed from the Linux command line interface (CLI).\n\nThis is an open source project. We would love your help. We have prepared a  guide to help you get started.\n\nIf this is your first PR, or you're not sure where to get started,\nsay hi in  and a team member would be happy to mentor you.\nJoin the  for questions and answers.\""

If you need to pass the QR somewhere else, here's how:\n\nPuppeteer takes care of the file downloading. The decryption is being done as fast as possible (outruns native methods). Supports big files!\n\nNot every available function is listed. For further information, refer to the documentation.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nClose the session properly to ensure the session is saved for the next time you log in (so it won't ask for QR scan again). Use \"autoClose: 0 | false\" to disable auto closing.\n\nYou can use cached versions of WhatsApp Web by passing the `webVersion` arguments as part of your Venom options.\n\nThis feature can use any version available in the list at [https://github.com/wppconnect-team/wa-version/tree/main/html](https://github.com/wppconnect-team/wa-version/tree/main/html)\n\n### Building Venom\n\nBuilding Venom is quite simple, despite containing three main projects:\n\n- Wapi project\n- Middleware\n- Venom\n\nTo build the entire project, run:\n\nMaintainers are needed, as the project is too large for me to keep up with all the updates.

Most of our ideas are crafted to work in any country that offers open data, but our main implementations focus in Brazil.\n\nEmpowering citizens with data is important: people talk about smart cities, surveillance and privacy. We prefer to focus on smart citizens, accountability and open knowledge.\n\nSerenata de Amor develops open source tools to make it easy for people to use open data. The focus is to gather relevant insights and share them in an accessible interface. Through this interface, we invite citizens to dialogue with politicians, state and government about public spendings.\n\nSerenata's main role is played by : she is an artificial intelligence who analyzes Brazilian congresspeople expenses while they are in office. Rosie can find suspicious spendings and engage citizens in the discussion about these findings.\n\nTo allow people to visualize and make sense of data Rosie generates, we have created . On this website, users can browse congresspeople expenses and get details about each of the suspicions. It is the starting point to validate a suspicion.\n\nWe have two main repositories .

This tool is designed to make it easy for anyone to translate SQL (Structured Query Language) commands into natural language and vice versa. SQL is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases, and while it's a powerful tool, it can also be quite complex and difficult to understand. On the other hand, natural language is the language that we speak and write in everyday life, and it's often the preferred way to communicate for people who are not familiar with technical jargon.\n\nWith the SQL and Natural Language Translator, you don't need to be a SQL expert to understand what's going on in your database, or to write SQL queries. You can simply type in your query in natural language and get the corresponding SQL code, or type in your SQL code and get a human-readable translation. This project is 100% free and open source.\n\nDark mode\nLowercase/uppercase toggle\nCopy to clipboard\nSQL syntax highlighting\nSchema awareness (beta)\nQuery history\n\nUsing the SQL to Natural Language Translator is easy. Simply navigate to the tool's website and choose whether you want to translate from natural language to SQL or from SQL to natural language. Then, type in your query and hit the \"translate\" button. The tool will generate the corresponding code or text and display it on the screen. You can press the 'reverse' button to give input as Natural Language and get SQL queries in response\n\n[ ] Functions (WIP)\n[ ] Procedures\n\nClone the repository:\n\nInstall the required packages:\n\nBuild the application:\n\nInput your OPENAI API key in the .env file, you can get your API key :\n\nStart the development server:\n\nClone the repository:\n\nInput your OPENAI API key in the .env.production file, you can get your API key :\n\nStart the development server:\n\nOnce the development server is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.\n\nEnter a natural language query in the input box and click \"Translate\" to generate the corresponding SQL code.

Building Malmo yourself from source is always an option!\n\nAdvantages:\n\nNo native code you don't have to build or install platform dependent code.\nA single network connection is used to run missions. No dynamic ports means it's more virtualization friendly.\nA simpler multi-agent coordination protocol. \nOne Minecraft client instance, one single port is used to start missions.\nLess impedance miss-match with the gym api.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe existing Malmo examples are not supported (as API used is different). \nMarlo envs should work with this.\nThe API is more limited (e.g. selecting video options) can edit mission xml directly.\n\nOn common Windows, MacOSX and Linux variants it is possible to use  to install Malmo as a python with native code package: . Once installed, the malmo Python module can be used to download source and examples and start up Minecraft with the Malmo game mod.\n\nAlternatively, a pre-built version of Malmo can be installed as follows:\n\nNOTE: This is _not_ the same as downloading a zip of the source from Github. _Doing this **will not work*unless you are planning to build the source code yourself (which is a lengthier process).

Perhaps there's some good stuff in here. Perhaps it can be brought back to life and used for something or other. However... for the most part, it is obsolete.\n\n---------------------This git repository contains the \"OpenCog Framework\", which has served as a (scientific, technical) laboratory for researching, exploring and learning how to integrate AI algorithms and systems into humanoid robotic systems. Most of the activity within this particular repo has focused on integrating natural language chat, common-sense reasoning, assorted learning algorithms, and motor control of humanoid robots.\n\nA stated goal of the  is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems.

We've already trained grand-master AI！This project contains:\n\n[x] Play demo and test code (try and play with our agent!)\n\n[x] First version of pre-trained SL and RL agent (only Zerg vs Zerg)\n\n[x] Training code of Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning *(updated by 2022-01-31)*(New! updated 2022-04-24)*(updated by 2022-04-01)[ ] More stronger pre-trained RL agents *(WIP)| \n\nPlease star us (click  button in the top-right of this page) to help DI-star agents to grow up faster :)\n\n\n\nEnvironment requirement:\n\nPython: 3.6-3.8\n\n\n\n\nDownload the retail version of StarCraftII: https://starcraft2.com\n\nNote: There is no retail version on Linux, please follow the instruction \n\nAdd SC2 installation path to environment variables  (skip this if you use default installation path on MacOS or Windows, which is `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\StarCraft II` or `/Applications/StarCraft II`):\n\n    On MacOS or Linux, input this in terminal:\n\n        \n\n    On Windows:\n       Right-click the Computer icon and choose Properties, or in Windows Control Panel, choose System.\n       Choose Advanced system settings.\n        On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables.\n        Click New to create a new environment variable, set  as the sc2 installation location.\n        After creating or modifying the environment variable, click Apply and then OK to have the change take effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPytorch Version 1.7.1 and CUDA is recommended, Follow instructions from \n\n\n\n**Note: GPU is neccessary for decent performance in realtime agent test, you can also use pytorch without cuda, but no performance guaranteed due to inference latency on cpu.\nMake sure you set SC2 at lowest picture quality before testing.*Double click the file , StarCraftII version 4.10.0 will be automatically downloaded.\n\nNote: We trained our models with versions from 4.8.2 to 4.9.Patch 5.0.9 has came out in March 15, 2022, Some changes have huge impact on performance, so we fix our version at 4.10.0 in evaluation.\n\n\n\nNote: Specify `rl_model` or `sl_model` after `--name` to download reinforcement learning model or supervised model.\n\nModel list:\n`sl_model`: training with human replays, skill is equal to diamond players.\n`rl_model`: used as default, training with reinforcement learning, skill is equal to master or grandmaster.\n`Abathur`: one of reinforcement learning models, likes playing mutalisk. \n`Brakk`:  one of reinforcement learning models, likes lingbane rush.\n`Dehaka`: one of reinforcement learning models, likes playing roach ravager.\n`Zagara`: one of reinforcement learning models, likes roach rush.\n\n\nWith the given model, we provide multiple tests with our agent.\n\n\n\nIt runs 2 StarCraftII instances. First one is controlled by our RL agent. Human player can play on the second one with full screen like normal game.\n\nNote: \nGPU and CUDA is required on default, add `--cpu` if you don't have these.\nDownload RL model first or specify other models (like supervised model) with argument `--model1 <model_name>`\nIn race cases, 2 StarCraftII instances may lose connection and agent won't issue any action. Please restart when this happens.\n\n\n\nIt runs 2 StarCraftII instances both controlled by our RL Agent, specify other model path with argument `--model1 <model_name> --model2 <model_name>`\n\n\n\nRL agent plays against built-in elite bot.\n\n\n\nIt is necessary to build different agents within one code base and still be able to make them play against each other.\nWe implement this by making actor and environment as common components and putting everything related to the agent into one directory.\nThe agent called default under distar/agent is an example of this. Every script under default uses relative import, which \nmakes them portable to anywhere as a whole part. \n\nIf you want to create a new agent with/without our default agent, follow instructions \n\nIf you want to train a new agent with our framework, follow instructions below and  is a guidance with more details of the whole training pipeline.\n\nStarCraftII client is required for replay decoding, follow instructions above.\n\n*pathcould be either a directory with replays or a file includes a replay path at each line.\n\nOptionally, separating replay decoding and model training could be more efficient, run the three scripts in different terminals:\n\n\nFor distributed training:\n\nHere is an example of training on a machine with 4 GPUs in remote mode:\n\n\nReinforcement learning will use supervised model as initial model, please download it first, StarCraftII client is also required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour components are used for RL training, just like SL training, they can be executed through different process:\n\n\nDistributed training is also supported like SL training.\n\n\nSlack: \n\n\nDiscord server: \n\n\n\n\n\nDI-star released under the Apache 2.0 license.\""

Check the above website to see which volumes have been completed and are available. The planned list is shown here.\n\nThe following volumes are planned for this series:\n\nVolume 0: Introduction to the Math of AI\nVolume 1: Fundamental Algorithms\nVolume 2: Nature Inspired Algorithms\nVolume 3: Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n\nIf you have a question, or wish to discuss something related to these books, you can find my Google Group here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/\n\nThis appendix describes how to obtain the “Artificial Intelligence for Humans” (AIFH) book series examples. This is probably the most dynamic area of the book. Computer languages are always changing and adding new versions. I will update the examples as this becomes necessary. There are also bugs and corrections. You are encouraged to always make sure you are using the latest version of the book examples. Because this area is so dynamic, this file may have become out of date. You can always find the latest version of this file at the following location.\n\nhttps://github.com/jeffheaton/aifh\n\nThe book’s examples are provided in a number of computer programming languages. Core example packs are provided for Java, C\n\nGithub provides an icon that allows you to simply download a ZIP file that contains all of the example code for the series. A single ZIP file is used to contain all of the examples for the series. Because of this, the contents of this ZIP are frequently updated. If you are starting a new volume, it is very important that you make sure you have the latest copy. The download can be performed from the following URL.\n\nhttps://github.com/jeffheaton/aifh\n\nYou can see the download link in Figure 1: GitHub\n\nAll examples can be obtained using the source control program git, if it is installed on your system. The following command clones the examples to your computer. Cloning simply refers to the process of copying the example files.\n\nYou can also pull the latest updates using the following command.\n\nIf you would like an introduction to git refer to the following URL.\n\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial\n\nThe entire “Artificial Intelligence for Humans” series is contained in one download. This download is a zip file. Once you open the examples file you will see the contents see in Figure 2: Examples Download\n\nThe license file describes the license used for the book examples. All of the examples for this series are released under the license. This is a Free and open-source software (FOSS) license. This means that I do retain a copyright to the files. However, you can freely reuse these files in both commercial and non-commercial projects without further permission. While the book source code is provided free, the book text is not provided free. These books are commercial products that I sell through a variety of means. You may not redistribute the actual books. This includes the PDF, MOBI, EPUB and any other format the book might be converted to. I do, however, provide all books in DRM-free form. Your support of this policy is greatly appreciated and does contribute to the future growth of these books.\n\nThere are also two README files included in the download. The README.md is a “markdown” file that contains images and formatting. The README.txt file is plane text. Both files contain the same information. For more information on MD files, refer to the following URL.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown\n\nYou will find README files at several levels of the examples download. The README file contained in the examples root (seen above) contains information about the book series. You will also notice the individual volume folders contained in the download. These are named vol1, vol2, etc. You may not see all of the volumes in the download. Not all of the volumes have been written yet! All of the volumes have the same format. For example, if you were to open Volume 1, you would see the contents listed in Figure 3: Inside Volume 1\n\nAgain, you see the two README files. These files contain information unique to this particular volume. The most important information contained in the volume level README files is the current status of the examples. The community often contributes example packs. This means that some of the example packs may not be complete. The README for the volume will let you know this important information. The volume README also contains the errata and FAQ for a volume.\n\nYou should also see a file named “chart.R”. This file contains the source code that I used to create many of the charts in the book. I use the R programming language to produce nearly all graphs and charts seen in the book. This allows you to see the equations behind the pictures. I do not translate this file to other programming languages. R is simply what I use in the production of the book. If I used another language, like Python, to produce some of the charts, you would see a “chart.py” along with the R code.\n\nYou can see that the above volume contains examples for C, C\n\nFigure 4 shows the contents of a typical language pack.\n\nFigure 4: The Java Language Pack\n\nNotice the README files again? The README files inside of a language folder are VERY important. Inside the above two README files you will find information about using the examples with Java. If you are having trouble using the book’s examples with a particular language, the README file should be your first stop. The other files seen above are all unique to Java. The README file above describes these in much greater detail.\n\nContributing to the Project\n\nDo you want to translate the examples to a new language? Have you found something broken, misspelled, or otherwise botched? You probably have. Fork the project and push a commit revision to GitHub. You will be credited among the growing number of contributors.\n\nThe process begins with a fork. You create an account on GitHub and fork the AIFH project. This creates a new project, with a copy of the AIFH files. You will then clone your new fork, in a similar way as was described for cloning the main AIFH repositiory. Once you make your changes you submit a “pull request”. Once I get this request I will evaluate your changes/additions and merge it with the main project.\n\nA much more detailed article on contributing through GitHub can be found here.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n\nIf you would like to cite Volume 1:\n\n@book{Heaton13a,\n\tAuthor = {Jeff Heaton},\n\tTitle = {Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms},\n\tPublisher = {CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform},\n\tYear = {2013},\n\tISBN = {1493682229}\n}\n\n%0 Book\n%T Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms\n%A Heaton, J.\n%N v. 1\n%@ 9781493682225\n%D 2013\n%I CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\n\nIf you would like to cite Volume 2:\n\n@book{Heaton14a,\n\tAuthor = {Jeff Heaton},\n\tTitle = {Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 2: Nature Inspired Algorithms},\n\tPublisher = {CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform},\n\tYear = {2014},\n\tISBN = {1499720572}\n}\n\n%0 Book\n%T Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 2: Nature Inspired Algorithms\n%A Heaton, J.\n%N v. 1\n%@ 1499720572\n%D 2014\n%I CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\""

Your task is to extract exactly 10 single or a maximum of two-word keywords from the provided README content. These keywords should represent the core focus, technologies, and unique contributions of the repository. Follow these rules: 1. Extract only unique keywords, AVOIDING PHRASES and LONG DESCRIPTIONS. 2. Provide only a clean, numbered list of 10 complete, concise keywords. NO EXPLANATIONS, HEADERS, SPECIAL CHARACTERS or extra formatting. 3. Ensure each keyword is concise, no longer than two words.

Focus on high-impact, domain-relevant keywords based on the content of the repository. 5. Do not use any special characters, and REMEMBER TO ENSURE ALL KEYWORDS ARE COMPLETE. Analyze the following README content and extract ONLY 10 COMPLETE single or a maximum of two-word high-impact keywords based on the instructions: \"AIMA exercises is an interactive and collaborative platform for digitalizing the exercises of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig.\n\nExercises for the book The idea is that in the fourth edition of the book, exercises will be online only (they will not appear in the book). This site will showcase the exercises, and will be a platform for students and teachers to add new exercises.\n\nThe present version of AIMA-Exercises uses Jekyll 3 and Ruby 2. To run the project locally:\n\nInstall a full\nInstall Jekyll and\nInstallation Guides:\nClone the project locally.\nGo to the folder directory where you cloned the project in the terminal.\n`gem install Jekyll bundler `\n`bundle exec Jekyll serve`\n\nThe directory structure is as follows:*`_includes` The include tag allows you to include the content from another file stored in the `_includes` folder and contains reusable files like `staticman_comments.html` which is the form used for submitting answers. Sidebar templates, head.html, and breadcrumb.\n`_layouts` They allow you to have the source code for project template in one place so you don’t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page. The layouts folder has default layout, homepage layout, exercise layout, answer submitted layout and others.\n`_site` This is where the generated site is placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. While contributing, don't change files in the `_site` directory as Github Pages is compatible with Jekyll and `_site` folder is updated every time the root directory folders are changed.\n`figures` The figures folder contains figures for all the exercises.\n`js` The JS folder contains the javascript codes for all the features. answer.js, bookmark.js , search.js , commsol.js, forms.js.\n`latex` Latex folder contains latex files for all the exercises.\n`markdown` `Markdown` folder contains markdown format of all the exercises along with the index.MD files for generating the exercises pages and the answers folder (if an answer is present for that particular exercise). Each exercise has it's own `answers` folder.\n`public` Public folder contains CSS files and fonts for the project.\n`search` Search folder contains index.MD file for rendering search results.\n`404.html` 404 page when a person reaches a page which is not present in the directory.\n`Gemfile` A Gemfile is a file we create which is used for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs. The Gemfile is where you specify which gems you want to use, and lets you specify which versions.\n`Gemfile.lock` The `Gemfile.lock` file is where Bundler records the exact versions that were installed. This way, when the same library/project is loaded on another machine, running bundle install will look at the Gemfile.lock and install the exact same versions, rather than just using the Gemfile and installing the most recent versions.\n`.jekyll-metadata` Incremental regeneration helps shorten build times by only generating documents and pages that were updated since the previous build. It does this by keeping track of both file modification times and inter-document dependencies in the `.jekyll-metadata` file.\n`LICENSE.md` License file for aima exercises project. It is released under standard MIT License.\n`README.md` Readme file for the project.\n`_config.yml` Configuration file used by jekyll for building the site.\n`index.html`The front page of the aima exercises project.\n`search_data.json` Search data used by lunr.js for searching through the exercises. It's a script which takes into account all the exercises.\n`staticman.yml` Staticman configuration file for sending automated Pull requests whenever a user submits an answer.\n\n4th Edition of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach will not have exercises. In fact, the exercises will be available online on this platform for students to solve.\n\n| Chapter                                  | LaTex File                                                                                                                                  | Status        | Markdown                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-Introduction                           |                                    | Implemented   |                                        |\n| 2-Intelligent-Agents                     |                                  | Implemented   |                                  |\n| 3-Solving-Problems-By-Searching          |                                  | Implemented   |                      |\n| 4-Beyond-Classical-Search                |                | Implemented   |                   |\n| 5-Adversarial-Search                     |                      | Implemented   |                           |\n| 6-Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems       |                                        | Implemented   |                      |\n| 7-Logical-Agents                         |              | Implemented   |                            |\n| 8-First-Order-Logic                      |                                        | Implemented   |                                     |\n| 9-Inference-In-First-Order-Logic         |            | Implemented   |          |\n| 10-Classical-Planning                    |                              | Implemented   |                              |\n| 11-Planning-And-Acting-In-The-Real-World |            | Implemented   |  |\n| 12-Knowledge-Representation              |                                          | Implemented   |                              |\n| 13-Quantifying-Uncertainity              |                        | Implemented   |                     |\n| 14-Probabilistic-Reasoning               |                          | Implemented   |                       |\n| 15-Probabilistic-Reasoning-Over-Time     |                                        | Implemented   |                    |\n| 16-Making-Simple-Decisions               |                | Implemented   |                  |\n| 17-Making-Complex-Decisions              |            | Implemented   |               |\n| 18-Learning-From-Examples                |              | Implemented   |                  |\n| 19-Knowledge-In-Learning                 |                                        | Implemented   |                                |\n| 20-Learning-Probabilistic-Models         |            | Implemented   |          |\n| 21-Reinforcement-Learning                |  | Implemented   |            |\n| 22-Natural-Language-Processing           |            | Implemented   |            |\n| 23-Natural-Language-For-Communication    |                        | Implemented   |           |\n| 24-Perception                            |                          | Implemented   |                                    |\n| 25-Robotics                              |                              | Implemented   |                                        |\n| 26-Philosophical-Foundations             |                          | Implemented   |                     |\n| 27-AI-The-Present-And-Future             |                                                                                                                                             |               |                                                                                                 |\n| Future Exercises                        |                                  | Unimplemented |                                   |\""

The third edition of the textbook is considerably larger, and this code did not keep up with errata or improvements in the algorithms. I have not use the code in this repository for my consulting work in over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe third edition of the textbook does not mention this code, but includes considerably expanded and corrected listings in the text in a language neutral format.

The only file that may need altering for your platform is\r\n./src/timing.cpp which currently wraps the windows multimedia timer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nBuilding with Scons\r\n------------------The code can be built using SCONS, available from\r\nhttp://www.scons.org/. Simply cd (change directory) into the build\r\ndirectory and type scons.\r\n\r\n> cd build\r\n> scons\r\n\r\nTo remove intermediate files after building (but leaving the library\r\nand demos):\r\n\r\n> scons -c ../src\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding with Microsoft Visual Studio 8 Professional\r\n---------------------------------------------------Solution and project files are included for use with Microsoft visual\r\nstudio 8 professional. They may also work with Express edition, but\r\nI've not tested that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding with CMake on Linux\r\n---------------------------The code can be built on Linux (and possibly on other platforms)\r\nusing CMake:\r\n\r\n  cd build\r\n  cmake .\r\n  make\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n------------To build the documentation (see below) you must have doxygen\r\ninstalled (it is available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/\r\nSimply cd into the ./doc/build/doxygen directory, then type:\r\n\r\n> doxygen aicore.config\r\n\r\nto build the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLayout\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe build process creates a statically linked library in ./lib which\r\ncan be used with the include headers in ./include. The demo programs\r\nare built and placed in the ./bin directory.\r\n\r\nSource code is contained in the ./src directory, and documentation\r\nis in the ./doc directory, in particular the reference documentation\r\nis in the ./doc/ref directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe source code is heavily documented, and the contents correspond to\r\nthe discussion in the \"Artificial Intelligence for Games\" book.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create 'doxygen' documentation with the tags in the\r\nsource code files, and a configuration for building the documentation\r\nis provided in the ./doc/build/doxygen directory. The doxygen\r\nconfiguration supplied provides only html output, since other output\r\nformats depend on how your machine is configured.\r\n\r\nThis is not currently targeted from the scons configuration, because\r\nscons suport for doxygen depends on where doxygen is installed on your\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo run the demos you will require OpenGL and GLUT installed on your\r\nmachine, and the relevant DLLs or shared objects on the path.\""

A great way to try out CLAI as a first step!\n\nA quick overview about the project.\n\nThe public release about this project.\n\nDeveloper API for CLAI skills.\n\nJoin our online Slack community by clicking here!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (including those about security, contributing, and other common topics).\n\nLink to a survey to help us improve our project going forward.\n\nA paper describing how this all works.\n\nLatest news about the project.\n\n\n\nBash 4.3 or higher is required if you are working on z/OS\n\nPython 3.6 or higher\n\nFor z/OS installations:\n\nRocket Python for z/OS\n\nFrom  via its' \n\nPlease see  for notes on the idiosyncrasies involved in installing CLAI on z/OS \n\nHomebrew\n\nfswatch if you are working on MacOS\n\nDocker if you are using the containerized version of CLAI (see below)\n\n\n\nOpen a Bash emulator or console. In the console navigate to the location of the CLAI project source code. Execute the necessary commands found in the preferred option below. You can specify the port with `--port`, the default is `8010`\n\n\nIn Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu, you need to install with this extra parameter:\n\n\nIn Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu, you need to install with this extra parameter:\n\n\nIn z/OS, you need to update your , , and .\n\n\nAfter the installation is complete, you will be prompted to restart the shell before CLAI becomes active.\n\n\n\nTo uninstall CLAI, execute the following command from the directory hosting the CLAI source code:\n\n\nIn Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu, you need to uninstall with this extra parameter:\n\n\nTo uninstall CLAI, execute the following command from the directory hosting the CLAI source code:\n\n\nIn Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu, you need to uninstall with this extra parameter:\n\n\nAs before, during installation, you will have to restart the shell for the changes to take effect.\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to try out CLAI inside a containerized environment. This may be useful while you are developing bots for CLAI or if you want to try out CLAI without affecting your host system. Start by building the Docker container as follows:\n\nMac OS Fedora and Ubuntu Control flags: Note that you may have to run `BuildDockerImage.sh` without the --no-cache flag for kernel version below 4.4.0-173-generic (Trusty Tahr/ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).\n\nThe end of a successful build process (this can take a while) should resemble the following output:\n\n\nOnce you have built the Docker image, you can run it locally or on a remote server with a copy of the docker image, by executing the following launch script. This script starts the CLAI-enabled container and sets up SSH forwarding from the physical host to the container.\n\nMac OS Fedora and Ubuntu You can determine what port your docker container is using (numbers marked between asterisks) for the SSH server as follows. Note that the port is assigned automatically and will be distinct for each docker instance you are testing.\n\nMac OS Fedora and Ubuntu Now you are ready to ssh into the docker container.\n\n\n\nIf you are not already in Bash, go into Bash by typing `>> bash`. You can continue interacting with a CLAI-enabled Bash as you would normally with Bash. At the core of CLAI is a set of skills that will show up in your interactions with the terminal if they are confident that they can improve your command line experience.\n\nAt any time, you can list the active skills by typing:\n\n\nYou can activate (and install) a skill specifically by invoking:\n\n\nOr remove (and uninstall) a skill specifically by invoking:\n\n\nYou can also start or stop the CLAI support as follows:\n\n\n> Warning: If you attempt to stop CLAI and start it again too rapidly, it is possible that you have to wait several seconds for internal process cleanup (socket closing and recycling) before the CLAI process will start completely.\n\n\n\nIf you want to allow CLAI to automatically execute commands without your explicit authorization and interaction, you can use the `auto` directive. Issuing the command again will toggle the auto-user mode on and off.\n\n\n\nIf you wish to set which plugins are activated by default, you can set them in  as follows:\n\n\nYou will need to reinstall CLAI and restart your shell for the changes to take effect.\n\n\n\nYour life on the terminal remains largely unaffected unless required by you or in reponsed to an error. Specifically, there are three ways in which CLAI skills may be invoked.\n\n$ command This is usual life on Bash. A skill may or may not show up in the standard interaction depending on their self-determined confidence of their usefulness in the context of that interaction.\n$ clai command This will invoke the CLAI skill with the highest confidence regardless of their confidence. Use this if you want to force CLAI to respond.\n$ clai \"skill-name\" command This will invoke the given skill name regardless of its own confidence and the confidences of the other active skills. Use this if you want to force a particular skill in CLAI to respond.\n\nIn all three cases, the Bash will behave as normal if CLAI has nothing to respond.\nGenerally, there are two ways in which a skill will come alive, as we describe next.\n\n\n\nA skill can respond to your command directly:\n\nThis could be an answer or command in response to something you typed into the terminal in natural language.\nThis could be an augmentation or fix to your command to make it work as intended.\n\nWithout the `auto` option (see above), a CLAI skill will always ask for your permission before executing an action on its own on your terminal.\n\n\n\nA skill can also respond the execution of your command:\n\nThis could be an addition to the `stdout` to provide you useful information about your task.\nThis could be a response to an `stderr` with a suggestion to fix the error or with useful troubleshooting information.\n\nAs before, CLAI skill will not execute without your permission unless `auto` mode is on.\n\n\n\nProject CLAI is intended to rekindle the spirit of AI softbots by providing a plug-and-play framework and simple interface abstractions to the Bash and its underlying operating system. Developers can access the command line through a simple `sense-act` API for rapid prototyping of newer and more complex AI capabilities.\n\nWant to build your own skills?

It covers all of the fundamentals of the math you'll need to know. The guide is an absolute life-saver for beginners, so you can study the topics that matter most, and an even better resource for practitioners such as myself who require a quick breeze-through on these concepts.\n\n**Note**: You don't need to know all of the concepts (below) in order to get your first job in Data Science. All you need is a *firm grasp of the fundamentals. Focus on those and consolidate them.\n\n**Knowledge of Algebra**: Algebra is perhaps fundamental to math in general. Besides mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, you'll need to know the following:\n\n**Linear Algebra**: The primary mathematical computation tool in Artificial Intelligence and many areas of Science and Engineering. In this, 4 primary mathematical objects and their properties need to be understood:\n- a single number (can be real or natural).\n- a list of numbers, arranged in order. Consider them as points in space with each element representing the coordinate along an axis.\n- a 2-D array of numbers where each number is identified by 2 indices.\n- an N-D array of numbers (N>2), arranged on a regular grid with N-axes. Important in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and special vectors and their corresponding scalar quantity. Understand the significance and how to find them.\n- factorization of a matrix into 3 matrices. Understand the properties and applications. \n- understand the significance, properties, and applications.\n\nProperties such as the **transpose**, **inverse**, and the **determinant** are useful to know as well.\n\n**Calculus**: Deals with changes in parameters, functions, errors and approximations. Working knowledge of multi-dimensional calculus is imperative in Data Science. The following are the most important concepts (albeit non-exhaustive) in Calculus:\n- rules (addition, product, chain rule etc), hyperbolic derivatives (tanh, cosh etc) and partial derivatives.\n- different derivative operators (Gradient, Jacobian, Hessian and Laplacian)\n- local/global maxima & minima, saddle points, convex functions, batches & mini-batches, stochastic gradient descent, and performance comparison.\n\n**Probability and Statistics**: These are crucial in Data Science. The following are important concepts:\n- Mean, median, mode, variance, covariance etc.\n- events (dependent & independent), sample spaces, conditional probability.\n- continuous & discrete distributions (expectation, variance, distributions (joint & conditional)).\n- Bayesian software helps machines recognize patterns and make decisions.\n- parameter estimation. Requires knowledge of fundamental probability concepts (joint probability and independence of events).\n- binomial, poisson, bernoulli, gaussian, exponential distributions.\n\n**Information Theory**: An important field that has made significant contributions to AI and Deep Learning, and is yet unknown to many. It can be thought of as an amalgamation of calculus, statistics and probability. Also called Shannon Entropy. Used to measure the uncertainty of an experiment. Compares two probability distributions & tells us how similar they are. Another measure of how similar two probability distributions are. Widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Speech. Used in Machine Translation RNNs & other models.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------In Artificial Intelligence, maths is very important. Without it, it's comparable to a human body without a soul. You can treat the mathematical concepts as a pay-as-you-go: whenever a foreign concept pops up, grab it and devour it! The guide above presents a minimal, yet comprehensive, resource to understand any kind of topic or concept in AI.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you think this roadmap can be improved, please do open a PR with any updates and submit any issues. We will continue to improve this, so you might want to consider watching/starring this repository to revisit it in the future.\n\n> Have a look at the **CONTRIBUTING.md** for how to update the roadmap.\n\nOpen a pull request with improvements\nDiscuss ideas in issues\nSpread the word\nReach out with any feedback\n\nThis roadmap was created by **Jason Dsouza** and made publically available under the MIT License.\""

It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.\n\nDuring the course of this book, you will find out how to make informed decisions about what algorithms to use in a given context. Starting from the basics of Artificial Intelligence, you will learn how to develop various building blocks using different data mining techniques. You will see how to implement different algorithms to get the best possible results, and will understand how to apply them to real-world scenarios. If you want to add an intelligence layer to any application that’s based on images, text, stock market, or some other form of data, this exciting book on Artificial Intelligence will definitely be your guide!\n\nAll of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter1 will look like the following:\n\nThis book is focused on artificial intelligence in Python as opposed to the Python itself. We have used Python 3 to build various applications. We focus on how to utilize various Python libraries in the best possible way to build real world applications. In that spirit, we have tried to keep all of the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different scenarios.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions.\n\nIf you have already purchased a print or Kindle version of this book, you can get a DRM-free PDF version at no cost.

A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).\n\nRead more \n\nThis project is split between implementation and analysis. First you will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then you will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.\n\nRead more \n\nIn this project you will choose an experiment with adversarial game-playing techniques like minimax, Monte Carlo tree search, opening books, and more. Your goal will be to build and evaluate the performance of your agent in a finite deterministic two player game of perfect information called Isolation.\n\nRead more \n\nIn this notebook, you'll use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora.

We will learn this in python by examining and deconstructing a method called  (EWC).\n\nI wish there were more learning tools in this style that directly try to help the learner connect the math to the code, and do it using a simple but completely end to end project. While it is true that the average programmer can load a \"out of the box\" library in 5 minutes and be running the latest model solving a common task in 15 minutes, I often hear from engineers that although they are engineers, they feel under-developed in the math that underlies recent academic research in machine learning. I have received criticism from some that believe tutorials like this provide a shortcut for \"average\" engineers to \"think\" they understand the math behind a new flashy artificial intelligence concept, who think the joy of reading these papers should be reserved for the traditionally trained academics that have gone through the years of formal coursework. I think there is nothing wrong with motivating learners using a cool AI concept to learn more of the fundamental math on their own.\n\n\"anyone can cook\" ratatouille\n\nThe ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. When an artificial neural network is trained on a new training set, unless that new training set includes all the old tasks combined with the new task, it generally is subject to catastrophic forgetting, whereby learning to solve new task B accompanies degradation of performance at old task A. In contrast, human neural networks can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. EWC addresses this problem by selectively slowing down learning on the weights (ie parameters, synaptic strengths) important for those old tasks.\n\n\n\nUbuntu 18.04.3 LTS (bionic)\nPython 3.8\nCuda 10.1\ncudnn7.6.4\nPyTorch 1.10.0\""

We believe that it is possible to rewrite these\nlibraries in native V and at the same time achieve the same speed delivered by them, but at the same\ntime, we want to allow to the users of VSL the possibility to choose when to use these libraries\nas a backend and when not. That is why each module documents the flags that allow this at the\ntime of use.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to optimize certain modules using different backends.\nFor this, there are some C dependencies that can be installed optionally.\nIf you want to use these C dependencies and other libraries,\nthe easiest way to work with VSL is via Docker.\nHaving Docker and VS Code installed, you can start developing powerful numerical simulations\nusing VSL in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, the best part of it is that it works on\nWindows, Linux, and macOS out of the box.\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\nClone <https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/hello-vsl>\nFollow the instructions in the README.md file of the repository :ok_hand:\n\nDone. And your system will remain \"clean\".\n\nOur \nalso contains V and the V Tools for working with VS Code (or not).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone. Installation completed.\n\n\n\nTo test the module, just type the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vlang/vsl/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=vlang/vsl\"/>\n</a>\n\nMade with .\n\n[awesomevbadge]: https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg\n[workflowbadge]: https://github.com/vlang/vsl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n[deploydocsbadge]: https://github.com/vlang/vsl/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml/badge.svg\n[licensebadge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg\n[ModulesBadge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modules-reference-027d9c?logo=v&logoColor=white&logoWidth=10\n[awesomevurl]: https://github.com/vlang/awesome-v/blob/master/README.md\n[workflowurl]: https://github.com/vlang/vsl/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n[deploydocsurl]: https://github.com/vlang/vsl/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml\n[licenseurl]: https://github.com/vlang/vsl/blob/main/LICENSE\n[ModulesUrl]: https://vlang.github.io/vsl/\n\n<!-Images -->\n\n[sierpinski_triangle]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/sierpinski_triangle.png\n[mandelbrot_blue_red_black]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/mandelbrot_blue_red_black.png\n[julia]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/julia.png\n[mandelbrot_basic]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/mandelbrot_basic.png\n[mandelbrot_pseudo_random_colors]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/mandelbrot_pseudo_random_colors.png\n[sierpinski_triangle2]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/sierpinski_triangle2.png\n[julia_set]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/julia_set.png\n[julia_basic]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlang/vsl/main/vcl/static/julia_basic.png\""

Over the span of five years, this research project has served its purpose—and gained a lot of ground—as a common way to share research code and test new ideas around aerial AI development and simulation. Additionally, time has yielded advancements in the way we apply technology to the real world, particularly through aerial mobility and autonomous systems. For example, drone delivery is no longer a sci-fi storyline—it’s a business reality, which means there are new needs to be met. We’ve learned a lot in the process, and we want to thank this community for your engagement along the way. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of forward momentum, we will be releasing a new simulation platform in the coming year and subsequently archiving the original 2017 AirSim. Users will still have access to the original AirSim code beyond that point, but no further updates will be made, effective immediately. Instead, we will focus our efforts on a new product, Microsoft Project AirSim, to meet the growing needs of the aerospace industry. Project AirSim will provide an end-to-end platform for safely developing and testing aerial autonomy through simulation. Users will benefit from the safety, code review, testing, advanced simulation, and AI capabilities that are uniquely available in a commercial product. As we get closer to the release of Project AirSim, there will be learning tools and features available to help you migrate to the new platform and to guide you through the product. To learn more about building aerial autonomy with the new Project AirSim, visit [link].\r\n\r\nAirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on [Unreal Engine] (we now also have an experimental [Unity plugin] release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. Similarly, we have an experimental release for a Unity plugin.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to develop AirSim as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, AirSim also exposes APIs to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way.\r\n\r\nCheck out the quick [1.5 minute demo]:\r\n- [Drones in AirSim]\r\n- [Cars in AirSim]\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [documentation].\r\n\r\nView our [website] on all aspects of AirSim.\r\n\r\nIf you have remote control (RC) as shown below, you can manually control the drone in the simulator. For cars, you can use arrow keys to drive manually.\r\n\r\nAirSim exposes APIs so you can interact with the vehicle in the simulation programmatically. You can use these APIs to retrieve images, get state, control the vehicle and so on. The APIs are exposed through the RPC, and are accessible via a variety of languages, including C++, Python, C++. \r\n\r\nThese APIs are also available as part of a separate, independent cross-platform library, so you can deploy them on a companion computer on your vehicle. This way you can write and test your code in the simulator, and later execute it on the real vehicles. Transfer learning and related research is one of our focus areas.\r\n\r\nNote that you can use the command line to specify the default vehicle or the new vehicle so you don't get prompted each time you start AirSim.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways you can generate training data from AirSim for deep learning. The easiest way is to simply press the record button in the lower right corner. This will start writing pose and images for each frame. The data logging code is pretty simple and you can modify it to your heart's content.\r\n\r\nA better way to generate training data exactly the way you want is by accessing the APIs.

How? We assume that the more sites we scrape the less chances of incorrect data. By scraping multiple sites per research, and choosing the most frequent information, the chances that they are all wrong is extremely low.\nWe do not aim to eliminate biases; we aim to reduce it as much as possible. **We are here as a community to figure out the most effective human/llm interactions.*In research, people also tend towards biases as most have already opinions on the topics they research about. This tool scrapes many opinions and will evenly explain diverse views that a biased person would never have read.\n\n--<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://star-history.com/\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=assafelovic/gpt-researcher&type=Date&theme=dark\" />\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=assafelovic/gpt-researcher&type=Date\" />\n    <img alt=\"Star History Chart\" src=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=assafelovic/gpt-researcher&type=Date\" />\n  </picture>\n</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">\n  <a href=\"\""

It aims to fill the need for a small, easily grokked codebase in which users can freely experiment with wild ideas (speculative research).\n\nOur design principles are:\n\nEasy experimentation: Make it easy for new users to run benchmark experiments.\nFlexible development: Make it easy for new users to try out research ideas.\nCompact and reliable: Provide implementations for a few, battle-tested algorithms.\nReproducible: Facilitate reproducibility in results. In particular, our setup follows the recommendations given by Machado et al. (2018).\n\nDopamine supports the following agents, implemented with jax:\n\nDQN (Mnih et al., 2015)\nC51 (Bellemare et al., 2017)\nRainbow (Hessel et al., 2018)\nIQN (Dabney et al., 2018)\nSAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018)\nPPO (Schulman et al., 2017)\n\nFor more information on the available agents, see the .\n\nMany of these agents also have a tensorflow (legacy) implementation, though newly added agents are likely to be jax-only.\n\nThis is not an official Google product.\n\n\nWe provide docker containers for using Dopamine.\nInstructions can be found .\n\nAlternatively, Dopamine can be installed from source (preferred) or installed with pip. For either of these methods, continue reading at prerequisites.\n\n\n\nDopamine supports Atari environments and Mujoco environments.

It is designed to be easy to develop for and evolve, without sacrificing performance in the common case. We leveraged the rich library ecosystem of .NET for API breadth, with open opportunities for optimization. Thanks to our careful use of .NET, Garnet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Linux and Windows.\n\nThis repo contains the code to build and run Garnet.

It includes features such as:\nCommand & control server with intuitive user-interface\nCustom payload generator for multiple platforms\n12 post-exploitation modules\n\nIt is designed to allow students and developers to easily implement their own code and add cool new\nfeatures *withouthaving to write a C2 server or Remote Administration Tool from scratch.\n\nThis project has 2 main parts: the **original console-based application*(`/byob`) and the **web GUI*(`/web-gui`).\n\n\n\n\nA control panel for your C2 server with a point-and-click interface for executing post-exploitation modules. The control panel includes an interactive map of client machines and a dashboard which allows efficient, intuitive administration of client machines.\n\n\n\n\nThe payload generator uses black magic involving Docker containers & Wine servers to compile executable payloads for any platform/architecture you select. These payloads spawn reverse TCP shells with communication over the network encrypted via AES-256 after generating a secure symmetric key using the .\n\n\n\n\nThe web app includes an in-browser terminal emulator so you can still have direct shell access even when using the web GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Generate fully-undetectable clients with staged payloads, remote imports, and unlimited post-exploitation modules1) __Remote Imports__: remotely import third-party packages from the server without writing them \nto the disk or downloading/installing them\n2) __Nothing Written To The Disk__: clients never write anything to the disk not even temporary files (zero IO\nsystem calls are made) because remote imports allow arbitrary code to be \ndynamically loaded into memory and directly imported into the currently running \nprocess\n3) __Zero Dependencies (Not Even Python Itself)__: client runs with just the python standard library, remotely imports any non-standard\npackages/modules from the server, and can be compiled with a standalone python \ninterpreter into a portable binary executable formatted for any platform/architecture,\nallowing it to run on anything, even when Python itself is missing on the target host\n4) __Add New Features With Just 1 Click__: any python script, module, or package you copy to the `./byob/modules/` directory\nautomatically becomes remotely importable & directly usable by every client while \nyour command & control server is running\n5) __Write Your Own Modules__: a basic module template is provided in `./byob/modules/` directory to make writing\nyour own modules a straight-forward, hassle-free process\n6) __Run Unlimited Modules Without Bloating File Size__: use remote imports to add unlimited features without adding a single byte to the\nclient's file size \n7) __Fully Updatable__: each client will periodically check the server for new content available for\nremote import, and will dynamically update its in-memory resources\nif anything has been added/removed\n8) __Platform Independent__: everything is written in Python (a platform-agnostic language) and the clients\ngenerated can optionally be compiled into a portable executable (*Windows*) or\nbundled into a standalone application (*macOS*)\n9) __Bypass Firewalls__: clients connect to the command & control server via reverse TCP connections, which\nwill bypass most firewalls because the default filter configurations primarily\nblock incoming connections\n10) __Counter-Measure Against Antivirus__: avoids being analyzed by antivirus by blocking processes with names of known antivirus\nproducts from spawning\n11) __Encrypt Payloads To Prevent Analysis__: the main client payload is encrypted with a random 256-bit key which exists solely\nin the payload stager which is generated along with it\n12) __Prevent Reverse-Engineering__: by default, clients will abort execution if a virtual machine or sandbox is detected\n\n\n\n\n*Post-exploitation modules that are remotely importable by clients1) __Persistence__ (`byob.modules.persistence`): establish persistence on the host machine using 5 different methods\n2) __Packet Sniffer__ (`byob.modules.packetsniffer`): run a packet sniffer on the host network & upload .pcap file\n3) __Escalate Privileges__ (`byob.modules.escalate`): attempt UAC bypass to gain unauthorized administrator privileges\n4) __Port Scanner__ (`byob.modules.portscanner`): scan the local network for other online devices & open ports\n5) __Keylogger__ (`byob.modules.keylogger`): logs the user’s keystrokes & the window name entered\n6) __Screenshot__ (`byob.modules.screenshot`): take a screenshot of current user’s desktop\n7) __Outlook__ (`byob.modules.outlook`): read/search/upload emails from the local Outlook client\n8) __Process Control__ (`byob.modules.process`): list/search/kill/monitor currently running processes on the host\n9) __iCloud__ (`byob.modules.icloud`): check for logged in iCloud account on macOS\n\n\n\n\n*Command & control server with persistent database and console1) __Console-Based User-Interface__: streamlined console interface for controlling client host machines remotely via\nreverse TCP shells which provide direct terminal access to the client host machines\n2) __Persistent SQLite Database__: lightweight database that stores identifying information about client host machines,\nallowing reverse TCP shell sessions to persist through disconnections of arbitrary\nduration and enabling long-term reconnaissance\n3) __Client-Server Architecture__: all python packages/modules installed locally are automatically made available for clients \nto remotely import without writing them to the disk of the target machines, allowing clients to use modules which require\npackages not installed on the target machines\n\n\n\n\n*Core framework modules used by the generator and the server1) __Utilities__ (`byob.core.util`): miscellaneous utility functions that are used by many modules\n2) __Security__ (`byob.core.security`): Diffie-Hellman IKE & 3 encryption modes (AES-256-OCB, AES-256-CBC, XOR-128)\n3) __Loaders__ (`byob.core.loaders`): remotely import any package/module/scripts from the server\n4) __Payloads__ (`byob.core.payloads`): reverse TCP shell designed to remotely import dependencies, packages & modules\n5) __Stagers__ (`byob.core.stagers`): generate unique payload stagers to prevent analysis & detection   \n6) __Generators__ (`byob.core.generators`): functions which all dynamically generate code for the client generator\n7) __DAO__ (`byob.core.dao`): handles interaction between command & control server and the SQLite database\n8) __Handler__ (`byob.core.handler`): HTTP POST request handler for remote file uploads to the server\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n*Contributors welcome! Feel free to issue pull-requests with any new features or improvements you have come up with!1) __Remote Import Encryption__ encryption for data streams of packages/modules being remotely imported (to maintain confidentiality/authenticity/integrity and prevent any remote code execution vulnerabilities arising from deserialization)\n2) __Transport Types__ add support for more transport types (HTTP/S, DNS, etc.)\n3) __Bug Fixes__ fix any\""

It was created with the aim of teaching the world how large Internet companies could obtain confidential information such as the status of sessions of their websites or services and control their users through their browser, without their knowledge, but It evolves with the aim of helping government organizations, companies and researchers to track the cybercriminals.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2018 was presented at BlackHat Arsenal in Singapore: https://www.blackhat.com/asia-18/arsenal.html\n\nSome benefits\n- LOCATOR OPTIMIZATION: Trace the path between you and the target you're tracking. Each time you make a move, the path will be updated, the location of the target is obtained silently through a bypass made in the browsers, allowing you to skip the location request on the victim's side, and at the same time maintain a precision of 99% in the locator.\n\n- APPROACH: When you're close to the target, Trape will tell you.\n\n- REST API: Generates an API (random or custom), and through this you can control and monitor other Web sites on the Internet remotely, getting the traffic of all visitors.\n\n- PROCESS HOOKS: Manages social engineering attacks or processes in the target's browser.\n  - SEVERAL: You can issue a phishing attack of any domain or service in real time as well as send malicious files to compromise the device of a target.\n  - INJECT JS: You keep the JavaScript code running free in real time, so you can manage the execution of a keylogger or your own custom functions in JS which will be reflected in the target's browser.\n  - SPEECH: A process of audio creation is maintained which is played in the browser of the target, by means of this you can execute personalized messages in different voices with languages in Spanish and English.\n\n- PUBLIC NETWORK TUNNEL: Trape has its own API that is linked to  to allow the automatic management of public network tunnels; So you can publish the content of your trape server which is executed locally to the Internet, to manage hooks or public attacks.\n\n- CLICK ATTACK TO GET CREDENTIALS: Automatically obtains the target credentials, recognizing your connection availability on a social network or Internet service.\n\n- NETWORK: You can get information about the user's network.\n  - SPEED: Viewing the target's network speed. (Ping, download, upload, type connection)\n  - HOSTS OR DEVICES: Here you can get a scan of all the devices that are connected in the target network automatically.\n\n- PROFILE: Brief summary of the target's behavior and important additional information about your device.\n  - GPU -- ENERGY 30-session recognition\n    - Session recognition is one of trape most interesting attractions, since you as a researcher can know remotely what service the target is connected to.\n\n- USABILITY: You can delete logs and view alerts for each process or action you run against each target.\n\nHow to use it\n- First unload the tool.\n- If it does not work, try to install all the libraries that are located in the file requirements.txt. Example of execution\n\nIf you face some problems installing the tool, it is probably due to Python versions conflicts, you should run a Python 2.7 environment :\n\nHELP AND OPTIONS\n- --url: In this option you add the URL you want to clone, which works as a decoy.\n- --port: Here you insert the port, where you are going to run the trape server.\n- --accesskey: You enter a custom key for the trape panel, if you do not insert it will generate an automatic key.\n- --injectcode: trape contains a REST API to play anywhere, using this option you can customize the name of the file to include, if it does not, generates a random name allusive to a token.\n- --local: Using this option you can call a local HTML file, this is the replacement of the --url option made to run a local lure in trape.\n- --ngrok: In this option you can enter a token, to run at the time of a process. This would replace the token saved in configurations.\n- --version: You can see the version number of trape.\n- --update: Option used to upgrade to the latest version of trape.\n- --help: It is used to see all the above options, from the executable.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis tool has been published educational purposes. It is intended to teach people how bad guys could track them, monitor them or obtain information from their credentials, we are not responsible for the use or the scope that someone may have through this project.\n\nWe are totally convinced that if we teach how vulnerable things really are, we can make the Internet a safer place.\n\nDeveloper\nThis development and others, the participants will be mentioned with name, Twitter and charge.\n\nCREATOR --Jose Pino (Security Researcher)\n\nHappy hacking!\nI invite you, if you use this tool helps to share, collaborate. Let's make the Internet a safer place, let's report.\""

Its primary purpose is to act as a testbed for research in artificial intelligence, especially deep reinforcement learning.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not an official Google product.\n\nIf you use DeepMind Lab in your research and would like to cite the DeepMind Lab environment, we suggest you cite the.\n\nYou can reach us at .\n\nGet.\n\nClone DeepMind Lab, e.g. by running\n\nFor a live example of a random agent, run\n\nHere is some documentation, including how to install dependencies if you don't have them.\n\nTo enable compiler optimizations, pass the flag --compilation_mode=opt, or -c opt for short, to each bazel build, bazel test and bazel run command. The flag is omitted from the examples here for brevity, but it should be used for real training and evaluation where performance matters.\n\nTo test the game using human input controls, run\n\nLeave the logToStdErr setting off to disable most log output.\n\nThe values of observations that the environment exposes can be printed at every step by adding a flag --observation OBSERVATION_NAME for each observation of interest.\n\nDeepMind Lab ships with an example random agent in examples which can be used as a starting point for implementing a learning agent. To let this agent interact with DeepMind Lab for training, run\n\nThe learning control center is used for agent-environment interactions. We also provide bindings to DeepMind's rl-gym general API for reinforcement learning, as well as a way to build a self-contained PIP package; see the DEEP_MIND_LAB.md for details.\n\nDeepMind Lab ships with [different levels](/docs/levels.md) implementing different tasks. These tasks can be configured using Lua scripts, as described in the [Lua API](/docs/developers/reference/lua_api.md).\n\nDeepMind Lab is built from the ioquake3 game engine, and it uses the tools q3map2 and bspc for map creation. Bug fixes and cleanups that originate with those projects are best fixed upstream and then merged into DeepMind Lab.\n\nbspc is taken from, revision d9a372db3fb6163bc49ead41c76c801a3d14cf. There are virtually no local modifications, although we integrate this code with the main ioq3 code and do not use their copy in the deps directory. We expect this code to be stable.\n\nq3map2 is taken from, revision d3d00345c542c8d7cc74e2e8a577bdf76f79c. A few minor local modifications add synchronization. We also expect this code to be stable.\n\nioquake3 is taken from, revision 29db64070aa0bae49953bddbedbed5e317af48ba. The code contains extensive modifications and additions. We aim to merge upstream changes occasionally.\n\nWe are very grateful to the maintainers of these repositories for all their hard work on maintaining high-quality code bases.\n\nDeepMind Lab currently ships as source code only. It depends on a few external software libraries, which we ship in several different ways:\n\nThe zlib, glib, libxml2, jpeg and png libraries are referenced as external Bazel sources, and Bazel BUILD files are provided. The dependent code itself should be fairly portable, but the BUILD rules we ship are specific to Linux on x86_64. To build on a different platform you will most likely have to edit those BUILD files.\n\nMessage digest algorithms are included in this package (in src/third_party/crypto), taken from the reference implementations of their respective RFCs. A \"generic reinforcement learning API\" is included in src/third_party/rl_api, which has also been created by the DeepMind Lab authors. This code is portable.\n\nEGL headers are included in this package (in src/third_party/GL/{,}), taken from the Khronos OpenGL/OpenGL ES XML API Registry at https://www.khronos.org/registry/. The headers have been modified slightly to remove the dependency of EGL on X.\n\nSeveral additional libraries are required but are not shipped in any form; they must be present on your system:\n\nSDL 2\ngettext (required by glib)\nOpenGL: A hardware driver and library are needed for hardware-accelerated human play. The headless library that machine learning agents will want to use can use either hardware-accelerated rendering via EGL or GLX or software rendering via OSMesa, depending on the --define headless=... build setting.\nPython 2.7 (other versions might work, too) with NumPy, PIL (a few tests require a NumPy version of at least 1.8), or Python 3 (at least 3.5) with NumPy and Pillow.\n\nThe build rules are using a few compiler settings that are specific to GCC. If some flags are not recognized by your compiler (typically those would be specific warning suppressions), you may have to edit those flags. The warnings should be noisy but harmless.\""

The highlight features of CleanRL are:\n\n- Single-file implementation\n  - Every detail about an algorithm variant is put into a single standalone file. For example, our `ppo_atari.py` only has 340 lines of code but contains all implementation details on how PPO works with Atari games, so it is a great reference implementation to read for folks who do not wish to read an entire modular library.\n- Benchmarked Implementation (7 algorithms and 34 games at https://benchmark.cleanrl.dev)\n- Tensorboard Logging\n- Local Reproducibility via Seeding\n- Videos of Gameplay Capturing\n- Experiment Management with \n- Cloud Integration with docker and AWS\n\nYou can read more about CleanRL in our  and .\n\nNotable CleanRL-related projects:\n\n- Offline RL algorithm implemented in CleanRL style\n- Fast optimized PyTorch implementation of CleanRL RL algorithms using CUDAGraphs.\n\n> ℹ️ **Support for Gymnasium**:  is the next generation of  that will continue to be maintained and introduce new features.

At the cost of duplicate code, we make all implementation details of a DRL algorithm variant easy to understand, so CleanRL comes with its own pros and cons. You should consider using CleanRL if you want to 1) understand all implementation details of an algorithm's varaint or 2) prototype advanced features that other modular DRL libraries do not support (CleanRL has minimal lines of code so it gives you great debugging experience and you don't have do a lot of subclassing like sometimes in modular DRL libraries).\n\nPrerequisites:\nPython >=3.7.1,<3.11\nTo run experiments locally, give the following a try:\n\nTo use experiment tracking with wandb, run\n\nIf you are not using `poetry`, you can install CleanRL with `requirements.txt`:\n\nTo run training scripts in other games:\n\nYou may also use a prebuilt development environment hosted in Gitpod:\n\n| Algorithm      | Variants Implemented |\n| ----------| ----------|\n| ✅   |  ,    |\n| |  ,   \n| |  ,   \n| |  ,   \n| |  ,   \n| | , \n| | , )\n| |  ,   \n| |  ,  \n| | ,  \n| | ,  \n| | ,  \n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| | ,   |\n| | ,  |\n| | ,  |\n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| |  ,   |\n| | ,  |\n| | ,  |\n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| |  ,   |\n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| | ,  \n| ✅  |  ,   |\n|  | ,   |\n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| ✅  |  ,   |\n| ✅   |  ,   |\n|  | ,  |\n\nTo make our experimental data transparent, CleanRL participates in a related project called , which contains tracked experiments from popular DRL libraries such as ours, , , , and others. \n\nCheck out https://benchmark.cleanrl.dev/ for a collection of Weights and Biases reports showcasing tracked DRL experiments.

If you only need this functionallity then please see . This will most likely be the preferred way to develop with Malmo Minecraft going forward.\n\nIf you wish to use the \"native\" Malmo implementation, either install the \"Malmo native Python wheel\" (if available for your platform) or a pre-built binary release (more on these options below). Building Malmo yourself from source is always an option!\n\nAdvantages:\n\nNo native code you don't have to build or install platform dependent code.\nA single network connection is used to run missions. No dynamic ports means it's more virtualization friendly.\nA simpler multi-agent coordination protocol. \nOne Minecraft client instance, one single port is used to start missions.\nLess impedance miss-match with the gym api.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe existing Malmo examples are not supported (as API used is different). \nMarlo envs should work with this .\nThe API is more limited (e.g. selecting video options) can edit mission xml directly.\n\n\n\nOn common Windows, MacOSX and Linux variants it is possible to use  to install Malmo as a python with native code package: . Once installed, the malmo Python module can be used to download source and examples and start up Minecraft with the Malmo game mod. \n\nAlternatively, a pre-built version of Malmo can be installed as follows:\n\nNOTE: This is _not_ the same as downloading a zip of the source from Github. _Doing this **will not work*unless you are planning to build the source code yourself (which is a lengthier process).

As long as a Minecraft game window has opened and is displaying the main menu, you are good to go.By default the Mod chooses port 10000 if available, and will search upwards for a free port if not, up to The port chosen is shown in the Mod config page.\n\nTo change the port while the Mod is running, use the `portOverride` setting in the Mod config page.\n\nThe Mod and the agents use other ports internally, and will find free ones in the range 10000-11000 so if administering\na machine for network use these TCP ports should be open.\n\n---`cd Cpp_Examples`\n\nTo run the pre-built sample:\n\n`run_mission` (on Windows)  \n`./run_mission` (on Linux or MacOSX)\n\nTo build the sample yourself:\n\n`cmake .`  \n`cmake --build .`  \n`./run_mission` (on Linux or MacOSX)  \n`Debug\\run_mission.exe` (on Windows)\n\n\n\nTo run the pre-built sample (on Windows):\n\n`cd CSharp_Examples`  \n`CSharpExamples_RunMission.exe`\n\nTo build the sample yourself, open CSharp_Examples/RunMission.csproj in Visual Studio.\n\nOr from the command-line:\n\n`cd CSharp_Examples`\n\nThen, on Windows:  \n\n\n\n\n`cd Java_Examples`  \n`java -cp MalmoJavaJar.jar:JavaExamples_run_mission.jar -Djava.library.path=.

Please visit our \n\nto download model checkpoints.\n\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.\n\nWe recommend at least 16GB RAM to load TimesFM dependencies.\n\n\nWe have released full pytorch support (excluding PEFT parts).\nShoutout to @tanmayshishodia for checking in PEFT methods like LoRA and DoRA.\nTo install TimesFM, you can now simply do: `pip install timesfm`.\nLaunched  that lets you finetune the weights of the pretrained TimesFM model on your own data.\nLaunched  with external regressors. More details .\n\n\ntimesfm-1.0-200m is the first open model checkpoint:\n\nIt performs univariate time series forecasting for context lengths up to 512 timepoints and any horizon lengths, with an optional frequency indicator.\nIt focuses on point forecasts, and does not support probabilistic forecasts. We experimentally offer quantile heads but they have not been calibrated after pretraining.\nIt requires the context to be contiguous (i.e. no \"holes\"), and the context and the horizon to be of the same frequency.\n\n\n\nPlease refer to our result tables on the  and the .\n\nPlease look into the README files in the respective benchmark directories within `experiments/` for instructions for running TimesFM on the respective benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using `pyenv` and `poetry`. In order to set these things up please follow the instructions . Note that the PAX (or JAX) version needs to run on python 3.10.x and the PyTorch version can run on >=3.11.x. Therefore make sure you have two versions of python installed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter than you can run the timesfm under `poetry shell` or do `poetry run python3 ...`.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter than you can run the timesfm under `poetry shell` or do `poetry run python3 ...`.\n\n**Note**: \n\nRunning the provided benchmarks would require additional dependencies.\nPlease see the `experiments` section fro more instructions.\n\nThe dependency `lingvo` does not support ARM architectures, and the code is not working for machines with Apple silicon. We are aware of this issue and are working on a solution. Stay tuned.\n\n\n\nRunning the provided benchmarks would require additional dependencies. Please see the `experiments` folder.\n\nThe dependency `lingvo` does not support ARM architectures, and the PAX version is not working for machines with Apple silicon.\n\n\n\nOn python 3.11 you can install the torch version using:\n\n\n\nOn python 3.10 you can install the pax version using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the base class can be loaded as,\n\n\n\nNote some of the parameters are fixed to load the 200m model\n\nThe `context_len` in `hparams` here can be set as the max context length **of the model**. **It needs to be a multiplier of `input_patch_len`, i.e. a multiplier of 32.*You can provide a shorter series to the `tfm.forecast()` function and the model will handle it. Currently, the model handles a max context length of 512, which can be increased in later releases. The input time series can have **any context length**. Padding / truncation will be handled by the inference code if needed.\n\nThe horizon length can be set to anything. We recommend setting it to the largest horizon length you would need in the forecasting tasks for your application. We generally recommend horizon length <= context length but it is not a requirement in the function call.\n\n`backend` is one of \"cpu\", \"gpu\", case sensitive.\n\n\n\nWe provide APIs to forecast from either array inputs or `pandas` dataframe. Both forecast methods expect (1) the input time series contexts, (2) along with their frequencies. Please look at the documentation of the functions `tfm.forecast()` and `tfm.forecast_on_df()` for detailed instructions.\n\nIn particular regarding the frequency, TimesFM expects a categorical indicator valued in {0, 1, 2}:\n\n**0*(default): high frequency, long horizon time series. We recommend using this for time series up to daily granularity.\n**1**: medium frequency time series. We recommend using this for weekly and monthly data.\n**2**: low frequency, short horizon time series. We recommend using this for anything beyond monthly, e.g. quarterly or yearly.\n\nThis categorical value should be directly provided with the array inputs. For dataframe inputs, we convert the conventional letter coding of frequencies to our expected categories, that\n\n**0**: T, MIN, H, D, B, U\n**1**: W, M\n**2**: Q, Y\n\nNotice you do **NOT*have to strictly follow our recommendation here. Although this is our setup during model training and we expect it to offer the best forecast result, you can also view the frequency input as a free parameter and modify it per your specific use case.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nArray inputs, with the frequencies set to low, medium and high respectively.\n\n\n\n`pandas` dataframe, with the frequency set to \"M\" monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have an external regressors library on top of TimesFM that can support static covariates as well as dynamic covariates available in the future. We have an usage example in .\n\nLet's take a toy example of forecasting sales for a grocery store: \n\n**Task:*Given the observed the daily sales of this week (7 days), forecast the daily sales of next week (7 days).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, besides the `Daily_sales`, we also have covariates `Category`, `Base_price`, `Weekday`, `Has_promotion`, `Daily_temperature`. Let's introduce some concepts:\n\n**Static covariates*are covariates for each time series. \nIn our example, `Category` is a **static categorical covariate**, \n`Base_price` is a **static numerical covariates**.\n\n**Dynamic covariates*are covaraites for each time stamps.\nDate / time related features can be usually treated as dynamic covariates.\nIn our example, `Weekday` and `Has_promotion` are **dynamic categorical covariates**.\n`Daily_temperate` is a **dynamic numerical covariate**.\n\n**Notice:*Here we make it mandatory that the dynamic covariates need to cover both the forecasting context and horizon. For example, all dynamic covariates in the example have 14 values: the first 7 correspond to the observed 7 days, and the last 7 correspond to the next 7 days.\n\nWe can now provide the past data of the two products along with static and dynamic covariates as a batch input to TimesFM and produce forecasts that take into the account the covariates. To learn more, check out the example in .\n\n\nWe have provided an example of finetuning the model on a new dataset in .\n\n\nIf you would like to submit a PR please make sure that you use our formatting style. We use  for formatting with the following options,\n\n\n\nPlease run `yapf --in-place --recursive <filename>` on all affected files.\""

More detailed documentation can be found at the .\n\nTo configure the board:\n\nDownload the repo and unfold. Remove the  main*(or any branch name) suffix of the folder.\n\nOpen the file OpenCat.ino, select your robot and board version.\n\nComment out cpp\n// \n\n\nPlug the USB uploader to the NyBoard and install the driver if no USB port is found under Arduino -> Tools -> Port.\n\nPress the upload button (->) at the top-left corner in Arduino IDE.\n\nOpen the serial monitor of Arduino IDE. You can find the button either under Tools, or at the top-right corner of the IDE.\n\nSet the serial monitor as no line ending and 115200 baud rate.\nThe serial prompts:\n\n\nInput ‘Y’ and hit enter, if you want to reset all the joint offsets to The program will do the reset, then update the constants and instinctive skills in the static memory.\n\nIMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) calibration.\n\nThe serial prompts:\n\nInput ‘Y’ and hit enter, if you have never calibrated the IMU or want to redo calibration.\n\nPut the robot flat on the table and don't touch it. The robot will long beep six times to give you enough time. Then it will read hundreds of sensor data and save the offsets. It will beep when the calibration finishes.\n\nWhen the serial monitor prints \"Ready!\", you can close the serial monitor to do the next step.\n\nUncomment cpp\n\n```\nWhen the serial monitor prints \"Ready!\", the robot is ready to take your next instructions.\n\nIf you have never calibrated the joints’ offsets or reset the offsets in Step2, you need to calibrate them. If you boot up the robot with one side up, it will enter the calibration state automatically for you to install the legs. Otherwise, it will enter the normal rest state\n\nYou can use the serial monitor to calibrate it directly. Or you may plug in the Bluetooth dongle, and use the Petoi app (on Android/iOS) for a more user-friendly interface. The mobile app is available on:\n\nIOS: \nAndroid: \n\nYou can refer to the calibration section in the user manual (https://bittle.petoi.com/6-calibration) and Guide for the Petoi App(https://docs.petoi.com/app-guide).\n\nyou can use the infrared remote or other applications (such as the Petoi App, Python, serial monitor ... etc.) to play with the robot (https://bittle.petoi.com/7-play-with-bittle).\n\nFor updates:\nstar this repository to receive timely notifications on changes.\nvisit www.petoi.com and  for project announcements.

These agents first and foremost\nserve both as reference implementations as well as providing strong baselines\nfor algorithm performance. However, the baseline agents exposed by Acme should\nalso provide enough flexibility and simplicity that they can be used as a\nstarting block for novel research. Finally, the building blocks of Acme are\ndesigned in such a way that the agents can be run at multiple scales (e.g.\nsingle-stream vs. distributed agents).\n\n\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to take a look at the detailed working code\nexamples found in the examples subdirectory. These show how to instantiate a\nnumber of different agents and run them within a variety of environments. See\nthe quickstart notebook for an even quicker dive into using a\nsingle agent. Even more detail on the internal construction of an agent can be\nfound inside our tutorial notebook. Finally, a full description Acme\nand its underlying components can be found by referring to the documentation.\nMore background information and details behind the design decisions can be found\nin our technical report.\n\n\n\n> NOTE: Acme is first and foremost a framework for RL research written by\n> researchers, for researchers. We use it for our own work on a daily basis. So\n> with that in mind, while we will make every attempt to keep everything in good\n> working order, things may break occasionally. But if so we will make our best\n> effort to fix them as quickly as possible!\n\nexamples/\n[tutorial]: https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/acme/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb\n[quickstart]: https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/acme/blob/master/examples/quickstart.ipynb\n[documentation]: https://dm-acme.readthedocs.io/\n[paper]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00979\n\n\n\nTo get up and running quickly just follow the steps below:\n\nWhile you can install Acme in your standard python environment, we\n    *stronglyrecommend using a\n    \n    to manage your dependencies. This should help to avoid version conflicts and\n    just generally make the installation process easier.\n\n    \n\nWhile the core dm-acme library can be pip installed directly, the set of\n    dependencies included for installation is minimal. In particular, to run any\n    of the included agents you will also need either [JAX] or [TensorFlow]\n    depending on the agent. As a result we recommend installing these components\n    as well, i.e.\n\n    \n\nFinally, to install a few example environments (including [gym],\n    [dm_control], and [bsuite]):\n\n    \n\n**Installing from github**: if you're interested in running the\n    bleeding-edge version of Acme, you can do so by cloning the Acme GitHub\n    repository and then executing following command from the main directory\n    (where setup.py is located):\n\n    \n\n\n\nIf you use Acme in your work, please cite the updated accompanying\n[technical report][paper]:\n\n\n\n[JAX]: https://github.com/google/jax\n[TensorFlow]: https://tensorflow.org\n[gym]: https://github.com/openai/gym\n[dm_control]: https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env\n[dm_env]: https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env\n[bsuite]: https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite\""

With the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19, these synthetic mRNAs have become broadly distributed RNA species in numerous human populations.  Despite their ubiquity, sequences are not always available for such RNAs.  Standard methods facilitate such sequencing.  In this note, we provide experimental sequence information for the RNA components of the initial Moderna (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/) and Pfizer/BioNTech (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/) COVID-19 vaccines, allowing a working assembly of the former and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.\n\nObjective: Sharing of sequence information for broadly used therapeutics has substantial benefit in design of improved clinical tools and precise diagnostics.  As examples of such applications, (i) Any medical or public health analysis relying on high throughput sequencing data to track SARS-COV2 and its variants would benefit from knowledge of vaccine sequences in order to distinguish RNA sequencing reads coming from the vaccine from those of viral origin, and (ii) Diagnostic labs designing nucleic acid surveillance tests (like PCR or LAMP assays) can benefit from vaccine sequence information to avoid confusion between vaccinated and infected test subjects when analyzing assay results. \n\nDescription: For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use.  To obtain the small amounts of RNA needed for characterization, vaccine remnants were phenol-chloroform extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), with intactness assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before and after extraction.  \n\nAlthough our analysis mainly focused on RNAs obtained as soon as possible following discard, we also analyzed samples which had been refrigerated (~4 ℃) for up to 42 days with and without the addition of EDTA.  Interestingly a substantial fraction of the RNA remained intact in these preparations.  We note that the formulation of the vaccines includes numerous key chemical components which are quite possibly unstable under these conditions-so these data certainly do not suggest that the vaccine as a biological agent is stable.  But it is of interest that chemical stability of RNA itself is not sufficient to preclude eventual development of vaccines with a much less involved cold-chain storage and transportation. \n\nFor further analysis, the initial RNAs were fragmented by heating to 94℃, primed with a random hexamer-tailed adaptor, amplified through a template-switch protocol (Takara SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq kit), and sequenced using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) with paired end 78-per end sequencing.  As a reference material in specific assays, we included RNA of known concentration and sequence (from bacteriophage MS2).\n\nFrom these data, we obtained partial information on strandedness and a set of segments that could be used for assembly.  This was particularly useful for the Moderna vaccine, for which the original vaccine RNA sequence was not available at the time our study was carried out.  Contigs encoding full-length spikes were assembled from the Moderna and Pfizer datasets.  The Pfizer/BioNTech data [Figure 1] verified the reported sequence for that vaccine (https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/), while the Moderna sequence [Figure 2] could not be checked against a published reference. \n\nRNA preparations lacking dsRNA are desirable in generating vaccine formulations as these will minimize an otherwise dramatic biological (and nonspecific) response that vertebrates have to double stranded character in RNA (https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243).  Numerous recent advances have resulted in approaches to minimize dsRNA (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30933724/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31900329/); nonetheless measurement remains a continued necessity.   In the sequence data that we analyzed, we found that the vast majority of reads were from the expected sense strand.  In addition, the minority of antisense reads appeared different from sense reads in lacking the characteristic extensions expected from the template switching protocol.  Examining only the reads with an evident template switch (as an indicator for strand-of-origin), we observed that both vaccines overwhelmingly yielded sense reads (>99.99%).  Independent sequencing assays and other experimental measurements are ongoing and will be needed to determine whether this template-switched sense read fraction in the SmarterSeq protocol indeed represents actual dsRNA content in the original material.\n\nDespite the transience of RNA from any individual inoculation, these mRNA vaccines and their derivatives will likely continue to be manufactured and administered as key tools for taming the ongoing COVID pandemic.  In such context, this work provides an initial assessment of two RNAs that are now a part of the human ecosystem and that are likely to appear in numerous other high throughput RNA-seq studies in which a fraction of the individuals may have previously been vaccinated.\n\nProtoAcknowledgements: We thank our colleagues here for their help and suggestions (Nimit Jain, Emily Greenwald, Nelson Hall, Lamia Wahba, William Wang, Amisha Kumar, Sameer Sundrani, David Lipman, Marc Salit), and additionally acknowledge numerous colleagues who have discussed and educated us (directly and indirectly) in areas of RNA synthesis enzymology, vaccine design, and software engineering.\n\nFigure 1: Spike-encoding contig assembled from BioNTech/Pfizer BNT-162b2 vaccine.  Although the full coding region is included, the nature of the methodology used for sequencing and assembly is such that the assembled cDNA-derived contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the vaccine RNA and would lack any indication of base modifications.  Within the assembled sequence, this hypothetical sequence shows a perfect match to the corresponding sequence from documents available online derived from manufacturer communications with the World Health Organization [as reported by https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/].. The 5’ end for the assembly matches the start site noted in these documents, while the read-based assembly lacks an interrupted polyA tail (A30(GCATATGACT)A70) that is expected to be present in the mRNA.  \n\nFigure 2: Spike-encoding contig assembled from Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine.  This is a partial sequence of the vaccine RNA.  Although the full coding region is included, the assembled contig could lack some sequence from the ends of the vaccine RNA.\""

Scenic has been successfully used to develop classification, segmentation, and detection models for multiple modalities including images, video, audio, and multimodal combinations of them.\n\nMore precisely, Scenic is a (i) set of shared light-weight libraries solving tasks commonly encountered when training large-scale (i.e. multi-device, multi-host) vision models; and (ii) several projects containing fully fleshed out problem-specific training and evaluation loops using these libraries.\n\nScenic is developed in  and uses\n.\n\nAmong others, Scenic provides\n\nBoilerplate code for launching experiments, summary writing, logging, profiling, etc;\nOptimized training and evaluation loops, losses, metrics, bi-partite matchers, etc;\nInput-pipelines for popular vision datasets;\n,\nincluding strong non-attentional baselines.\n\nThere are some SOTA models and baselines in Scenic which were either developed using Scenic, or have been reimplemented in Scenic:\n\nProjects that were developed in Scenic or used it for their experiments:\n\nMore information can be found in .\n\nBaselines that were reproduced in Scenic:\n\nMore information can be found in .\n\n<a name=\"philosophy\"></a>\n\nScenic aims to facilitate rapid prototyping of large-scale vision models. To keep the code simple to understand and extend we prefer *forking and copy-pasting over adding complexity or increasing abstraction*. Only when functionality proves to be widely useful across many models and tasks it may be upstreamed to Scenic's shared libraries.\n\n<a name=\"getting_start\"></a>\n\nSee `projects/baselines/README.md` for a walk-through baseline models and instructions on how to run the code. If you would like to contribute to Scenic, please check out the ,  and   sections. Should your contribution be a part of the shared libraries, please send us a pull request!\n\nYou will need Python 3.9 or later. Download the code from GitHub\n\nand run training for ViT on ImageNet:\n\nNote that for specific projects and baselines, you might need to install extra packages that are mentioned in their `README.md` or `requirements.txt` files.\n\nis also a minimal colab to train a simple feed-forward model using Scenic.\n\n<a name=\"code_structure\"></a>\n\nScenic is designed to propose different levels of abstraction, to support hosting projects that only require changing hyper-parameters by defining config files, to those that need customization on the input pipeline, model architecture, losses and metrics, and the training loop. To make this happen, the code in Scenic is organized as either _project-level_ code, which refers to customized code for specific projects or baselines or _library-level_ code, which refers to common functionalities and general patterns that are adapted by the majority of projects. The project-level code lives in the `projects` directory.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/scenic/main/images/scenic_design.jpg\" width=\"900\" alt=\"scenic design\"></img>\n</div>\n\nThe goal is to keep the library-level code minimal and well-tested and to avoid introducing extra abstractions to support minor use-cases. Shared libraries provided by Scenic are split into:\n\n`dataset_lib`: Implements IO pipelines for loading and pre-processing data for common Computer Vision tasks and benchmarks (see \"Tasks and Datasets\" section). All pipelines are designed to be scalable and support multi-host and multi-device setups, taking care of dividing data among multiple hosts, incomplete batches, caching, pre-fetching, etc.\n`model_lib` : Provides\n    several abstract model interfaces (e.g. `ClassificationModel` or `SegmentationModel` in `model_lib.base_models`) with task-specific losses and metrics;\n    neural network layers in `model_lib.layers`, focusing on efficient implementation of attention and transformer layers;\n    accelerator-friendly implementations of bipartite matching algorithms in `model_lib.matchers`.\n`train_lib`: Provides tools for constructing training loops and implements several optimized trainers (classification trainer and segmentation trainer) that can be forked for customization.\n`common_lib`: General utilities, like logging and debugging modules, functionalities for processing raw data, etc.\n\nScenic supports the development of customized solutions for customized tasks and data via the concept of \"project\". There is no one-fits-all recipe for how much code should be re-used by a project. Projects can consist of only configs and use the common models, trainers, task/data that live in library-level code, or they can simply fork any of the mentioned functionalities and redefine, layers, losses, metrics, logging methods, tasks, architectures, as well as training and evaluation loops. The modularity of library-level code makes it flexible for projects to fall placed on any spot in the \"run-as-is\" to \"fully customized\" spectrum.\n\nCommon baselines such as a ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) are implemented in the \nproject. Forking models in this directory is a good starting point for new projects.\n\nIf you use Scenic, you can cite our .\nHere is an example BibTeX entry:\n\n_Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product._\""

Due to this, Motion Style Transfer (MST) has been drawing attention recently, which aims to convert the motion in a clip with a given content into another motion in a different style, while keeping the same content. A motion is composed of a content and style, where content is the base of the motion and style comprises of the attributes such as mood and personality of the character tied to the motion.\n\nThe datasets contain a diverse range of contents such as daily activities, fighting, and dancing; with styles such as active, tired, and happy. These can be used as training data for MST models. The animation below shows examples of visualized motions.\n\nCurrently, two datasets are available in this repository and are both located under the `dataset` directory. \n\nBandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-1()\n    17 types of wide-range contents including daily activities, fighting, and dancing.\n    15 styles that include expression variety.\n    A total of 36,673 frames.\n\n<img src=\"src/Bandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-1/movie_walk.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n\nBandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-2()\n    10 types of content mainly focusing on locomotion and hand actions.\n    7 styles that use a single, uniform expression.\n    A total of 384,931 frames.\n\n<img src=\"src/Bandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-2/movie_walk.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n\nYou can find a sample script for visualization (using Blender) including step-by-step instructions under the `utils` directory. Please see  for details.\n\n\nEach dataset is based on the motion of three professional actors, collected at the motion capture studio of Bandai Namco. We applied post-processing such as noise removal, proportion alignment, and clipping; and saved in BVH format.\n\n<img src='src/images/motion_capture_studio.png' width=\"50%\"/>\n\n\n\nThe technical details regarding this dataset are described in the following paper.\n\nIf you use this dataset, please consider citing the paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe datasets and scripts are available in the following lincenses.\nBandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-1: \nBandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset-2: \nMotion visualization on Blender: \n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the field of MST has been drawing attention as of late.

To get the best performance, you need to optimise for many components: among them, a very important one is the models you use for retrieval.\n\nDense retrieval, i.e. using embeddings such as OpenAI's text-ada-002, is a good baseline, but there's a lot of research.\n\nThe Information Retrieval research field has recently been booming, and models like ColBERT have been shown to perform well, are scalable, and are even state-of-the-art! Unfortunately, most of those new approaches aren't very well known, and are much harder to use than dense embeddings.\n\nThis is where RAGatouille comes in: RAGatouille's purpose is to bridge this gap: make it easy to use state-of-the-art methods in your RAG pipeline, without having to worry about the details or the years of literature! At the moment, RAGatouille focuses on making ColBERT simple to use. If you want to check out what's coming next, you can check out our roadmap!\n\nIf you want to read more about the motivations, philosophy, and why the late-interaction approach used by ColBERT works so well, check out the research paper.\n\nWant to give it a try? Nothing easier, just run `pip install ragatouille` and you're good to go!\n\n⚠️ Running notes/requirements: ⚠️\n\nIf running inside a script, you must run it inside `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`. Windows is not supported. RAGatouille doesn't appear to work outside WSL and has issues with WSL. Some users have had success running RAGatouille in WSL.\n\nRAGatouille makes it as simple as can be to use ColBERT! We want the library to work on two levels:\n\nStrong, but parameterizable defaults: you should be able to get started with just a few lines of code and still leverage the full power of ColBERT, and you should be able to tweak any relevant parameter if you need to!\nPowerful yet simple re-usable components under-the-hood: any part of the library should be usable stand-alone. You can use our DataProcessor or our negative miners outside of `RAGPretrainedModel` and `RagTrainer`, and you can even write your own negative miner and use it in the pipeline if you want to!\n\nIn this section, we'll quickly walk you through the three core aspects of RAGatouille:\n\n➡️ If you want just want to see fully functional code examples, head over to the API documentation.\n\nIf you're just prototyping, you don't need to train your own model! While finetuning can be useful, one of the strength of ColBERT is that the pretrained models are particularly good at generalisation, and have exceptional zero-shot retrieval performance in new domains!\n\nRAGatouille's RAGTrainer has a built-in `TrainingDataProcessor`, which can take most forms of retrieval training data, and automatically convert it to training triplets, with data enhancements. The pipeline works as follows:\n\nAccepts pairs, labelled pairs and various forms of triplets as inputs (\""
