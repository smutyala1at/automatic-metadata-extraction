Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>."

Motivation ========== Research on modern computational quantum chemistry relies on a set of computational tools to carry out calculations. The complexity of the calculations usually requires intercommunication between the aforementioned tools, such communication is usually done through shell scripts that try to automate input/output actions like: launching the computations in a cluster, reading the resulting output and feeding the relevant numerical result to another program. Such scripts are difficult to maintain and extend, requiring a significant programming expertise to work with them. Being then desirable a set of automatic and extensible tools that allows to perform complex simulations in heterogeneous hardware platforms. This library tackles the construction and efficient execution of computational chemistry workflows. This allows computational chemists to use the emerging massively parallel compute environments in an easy manner and focus on interpretation of scientific data rather than on tedious job submission procedures and manual data processing. Description =========== This library consists of a set of modules written in Python3 to automate the following tasks: 1. Input generation. 2. Handle tasks dependencies (Noodles_). 3. Advanced molecular manipulation capabilities with (rdkit_). 4. Jobs failure detection and recovery. 5. Numerical data storage (h5py_). Tutorial and Examples --------------------- A tutorial written as a jupyter-notebook_ is available from: tutorial-qmflows_. You can also access direclty more advanced examples_. Installation ============ - Download miniconda for python3: miniconda_ (also you can install the complete anaconda_ version). - Install according to: installConda_. - Create a new virtual environment using the following commands: - ``conda create -n qmflows`` - Activate the new virtual environment - ``source activate qmflows`` To exit the virtual environment type ``source deactivate``. .. _dependecies: Dependencies installation ------------------------- - Type in your terminal: ``conda activate qmflows`` Using the conda environment the following packages should be installed: - install rdkit_ and h5py_ using conda: - ``conda install -y -q -c conda-forge rdkit h5py`` -

What Kernel Tuner does: - Works as an external tool to benchmark and optimize GPU kernels in isolation - Can be used directly on existing kernel code without extensive changes - Can be used with applications in any host programming language - Blazing fast search space construction - More than 20 [optimization algorithms](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/optimization.html) to speedup tuning - Energy measurements and optimizations [(power capping, clock frequency tuning)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07260) - ... and much more! For example, [caching](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/cache_files.html), [output verification](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/correctness.html), [tuning host and device code](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/hostcode.html), [user defined metrics](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/metrics.html), see [the full documentation](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/index.html). ## Installation - First, make sure you have your [CUDA](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/install.html#cuda-and-pycuda), [OpenCL](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/install.html#opencl-and-pyopencl), or [HIP](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/install.html#hip-and-hip-python) compiler installed - Then type: `pip install kernel_tuner[cuda]`, `pip install kernel_tuner[opencl]`, or `pip install kernel_tuner[hip]` - or why not all of them: `pip install kernel_tuner[cuda,opencl,hip]` More information on installation, also for other languages, in the [installation guide](http://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/install.html). ## Example ```python import numpy as np from kernel_tuner import tune_kernel kernel_string = """""" __global__ void vector_add(float *c, float *a, float *b, int n) { int i = blockIdx.x * block_size_x + threadIdx.x; if (i<n) { c[i] = a[i] + b[i]; } } """""" n = np.int32(10000000) a = np.random.randn(n).astype(np.float32) b = np.random.randn(n).astype(np.float32) c = np.zeros_like(a) args = [c, a, b, n] tune_params = {""block_size_x"": [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]} tune_kernel(""vector_add"", kernel_string, n, args, tune_params) ``` More [examples here](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_tuner/stable/examples.html). ## Resources -

https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template,"# Netherlands eScience Center Python Template <img align=""right"" width=""160"" src=""logo.png"" alt='Python Template logo, created using ChatGPT 4o on 10 September 2024 using prompt ""generate a logo of a copier that looks like a snake-scientist""'> Spend less time setting up and configuring your new Python packages by using this template. This [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) template includes best practices for research software so your new package will include these practices from the start. You can choose from various user profiles, each offering a range of features to suit your needs. ## User profiles The template profiles for a Python package offer varying levels of customization to cater to different user needs. Below are the profiles the template offers. ### Minimum This profile offers the essential features to begin developing a Python package, making it ideal for first-time research software developers. Additional features can be added as needed. ### Recommended This option provides a pre-selected set of features for research software, which users can fully customize. ### Let me choose This fully customizable profile enables you to selectively include or exclude features in your Python package. ## Features - Boilerplate unit tests and documentation, - [Python static setup configuration](template/pyproject.toml.jinja), - Open source software license, - Continuous integration with [GitHub action workflows](template/.github/workflows) for building, testing, link checking and linting, - Code style checking with [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/), - [Editorconfig](template/.editorconfig), - Usage and contribution documents: - [README.md](template/README.md.jinja) for package users, - [README.dev.md](template/README.dev.md.jinja) for package developer, - [project_setup.md](template/project_setup.md.jinja) with extensive documentation about project setup, - [Changelog](template/%7B%25%20if%20AddChangeLog%20%25%7DCHANGELOG.md%7B%25%20endif%20%25%7D), - [Code of Conduct](template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.jinja), - [Contributing guidelines](template/CONTRIBUTING.md.jinja), - Continuous code quality and code coverage reporting using [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/), - Automatic creation of [issues](template/.github/next_steps) with instructions how to pass all GitHub action workflows and integrate with services like Zenodo and Read the Docs, - Instructions how to make package [citable](.github/next_steps/%7B%25%20if%20AddCitation%20%25%7D02_citation.md%7B%25%20endif%20%25%7D.jinja) - FAIR software recommendation badge, - Optional [pre commit hook](template/README.dev.md.jinja#running-linters-locally) to catch lint errors early ## Badges | fair-software.nl recommendations | | | :-- | :-- | | (1/5) code repository | [![github repo badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-000.svg?logo=github&labelColor=gray&color=blue)](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template) | | (2/5) license | [![github license badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nlesc/python-template)](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template) | | (3/5) community registry | [![RSD](https://img.shields.io/badge/rsd-python--template-00a3e3.svg)](https://research-software.nl/software/nlesc-python-template) | | (4/5) citation | [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1310751.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1310751) | | (5/5) checklist | &nbsp; | | overall | [![fair-software badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/fair--software.eu-%E2%97%8F%20%20%E2%97%8F%20%20%E2%97%8F%20%20%E2%97%8F%20%20%E2%97%8B-yellow)](https://fair-software.eu) | | **Other best practices** | &nbsp; | | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | | **GitHub Actions** | &nbsp; | | Citation metadata consistency | [![cffconvert](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/cffconvert.yml) | | Link checker | [![link-check](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/link-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/link-check.yml) | | Tests | [![tests](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nlesc/python-template/actions/workflows/tests.yml) | ## How to use There are multiple scenarios to use this template: - [Scenario 1](#scenario-1-create-a-new-package): Generating a new package using template - [Scenario 2](#scenario-2-apply-to-pre-existing-code): Applying the template to some pre-existing code - [Scenario 3](#scenario-3-updating-a-template-made-package): Updating a package made with the template In all three scenarios, you will need to install Copier first, which we recommend doing with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx): ```shell python3 -m pip install --user pipx python3 -m pipx ensurepath pipx install copier ``` > [!NOTE] > Note that it is also possible to install Copier with regular `pip`, but that > Copier will then be installed in your common environment and may cause > conflicts with its dependencies, while `pipx` will install Copier in a > separate and dedicated environment. ### Scenario 1: Create a new package Run `copier copy` with the template: ```shell copier copy https://github.com/nlesc/python-template.git path/to/destination ``` > [!NOTE] > 1. Make sure that `path/to/destination` is an empty directory > 1. Based on the profile and selected features, the package will be generated in the specified destination directory For an explanation of what's there, read on in the `project_setup.md` file. ### Scenario 2: Apply to pre-existing code To apply the template to pre-existing code, you can use the same `copier copy` command as when creating a new package, except that you point to the folder containing your existing code rather than a new one: ```shell copier copy https://github.com/nlesc/python-template.git path/to/existing/code ``` This works because if `path/to/destination` already exists, Copier will update what is already there by either adding new files or updating existing files. Copier will ask to overwrite any files that resulted in conflicts. Especially if your files are already under version control, it is recommended to answer 'yes' for all files, you will still be able to review the changes suggested by the template. ### Scenario 3. Updating a template-made package Copier provides the functionality for re-applying the template to a previously created project using the `copier update` command. This has two effects: 1. Your project will be updated according to the latest version of the template 2. You can change any of your previous answers to apply these changes throughout your entire project. > [!CAUTION] > Do not manually update answers in `.copier-answers.yml`, > as it will result in unexpected behavior. ```shell cd path/to/project copier update ``` If you don't want to change any of your answers, but only want to update your project according to the latest template updates, you can provide the `--skip-answered` option. This tells Copier to reuse all of your previous answers, and simply bring in all updates from the template into your current project, such as updating which Python versions are supported. You will still be asked to answer any new questions that have been added to the template since you last applied it. ```shell copier update --skip-answered ``` ## Examples Many developers have gone before you in using this template to get started quickly.

The [JSON schema (app/public/schema.json)](app/public/schema.json) describes the format of an project. [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/iomega/paired-data-form/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iomega/paired-data-form/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22CI) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=iomega_paired-data-form&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=iomega_paired-data-form) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=iomega_paired-data-form&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=iomega_paired-data-form) [![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3757/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3757) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2656630.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2656630) ## Documentation Developer, admin and system operator manuals can be found in [manuals/](manuals/) directory. ## Contributing If you want to contribute to the platform, have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). ## Architecture The Pairing Omics Data Platform consists of: 1. A Web application, user interface, see [app/](app/) directory 2. An API web service, service responsible for storing projects, see [api.](api/) directory [![Architecture diagram](app/src/pages/methods/architecture.svg)](app/src/pages/methods/architecture.svg) The platform is implemented using Javascript based web service and a React (v16.13.1) based web application. The web application renders the submission form from the JSON schema. The web service stores each project as a file on disk. The application offers full text search functionality via web services using an elastic search (v7.6.2) index. The web service uses a redis queue (v5.0.5) to schedule jobs to fetch more information about the public identifiers and to upload the projects to Zenodo each month. For example, the scientific species name is fetched from GenBank using the public genome identifiers in the project. The web service has an OpenAPI (v3.0.3) specification ([https://www.openapis.org/](https://www.openapis.org/)) which can be used to submit and retrieve projects in a programmatic manner. The platform runs using Docker Compose (v1.25.4) with containers for the web application, web service and redis queue. ## Run using Docker compose The application can be configured using environment variables: * PORT, http port application is running on. Default is 8443. * SHARED_TOKEN, token required to login to review area. * ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN, Zenodo access token used for uploading database to Zenodo. * ZENODO_DEPOSITION_ID, Zenodo deposition identifier used for uploading database to Zenodo. Set to -1 to disable scheduled uploading. * SLACK_TOKEN, Token of Slack app with chat:write permission in workspace of channel * SLACK_CHANNEL, Slack channel in which service should post messages The environment variables can be set in the terminal or be put in a `.env` file. ```shell docker-compose up -d --build ``` Starts application, api webservice and reverse proxy on [http://localhost:8443](http://localhost:8443). Project JSON files are stored in a `./data/` directory. To run on production put application behind a reverse proxy web server with a proper domain and secure transport with https. ## New release This chapter is for developers of the platform. To make a new release of the platform do: 1. Determine new version of release, using semantic versioning (x.y.z) 2. Add version to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) * Create a new `##` chapter for the new version * Update version links at bottom of CHANGELOG 3. Set new version of api web service by ```shell cd api npm version x.y.z ``` 4. Set new version of web application by ```shell cd app npm version x.y.z ``` 5. Commit & push changes 6. Create a GitHub release 7. On [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2656630](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2656630) * Update author list * Add `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3736430`, `is compiled/create by this upload` as `Dataset` in related identifiers section.

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

Its features include a hierarchy of available stress balances, marine ice sheet physics with dynamic calving fronts, an enthalpy-based conservation of energy scheme, bed deformation and subglacial hydrology components, extensible coupling to atmospheric and ocean models, and comprehensive user documentation. PISM uses distributed-memory (PETSc- and MPI-based) parallelism for high-resolution simulations. PISM is jointly developed at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). keywords: - ice sheet model - open source - geophysics - sea level license: GPL-3.0-or-later"

The advantage of deep learning is that it can handle raw data directly, without the need to compute signal features. Deep learning does not require expert domain knowledge about the data, and has been shown to be competitive with conventional machine learning techniques. As an example, you can apply mcfly on accelerometer data for activity classification, as shown in [the tutorial](https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly-tutorial). If you use mcfly in your research, please cite the following software paper: D. van Kuppevelt, C. Meijer, F. Huber, A. van der Ploeg, S. Georgievska, V.T. van Hees. _Mcfly: Automated deep learning on time series._ SoftwareX, Volume 12, 2020. [doi: 10.1016/j.softx.2020.100548](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100548) ## Installation Prerequisites: - Python 3.10, 3.11 - pip - Tensorflow 2 Installing all dependencies in separate conda environment: ```sh conda env create -f environment.yml # activate this new environment source activate mcfly ``` To install the package, run in the project directory: `pip install mcfly` ## Visualization We build a tool to visualize the configuration and performance of the models. The tool can be found on http://nlesc.github.io/mcfly/. To run the model visualization on your own computer, cd to the `html` directory and start up a python web server: `python -m http.server 8888 &` Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/` in your browser to open the visualization. For a more elaborate description of the visualization see [user manual](https://mcfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual.html). ## User documentation [User and code documentation](https://mcfly.readthedocs.io). ## Contributing You are welcome to contribute to the code via pull requests. Please have a look at the [NLeSC guide](https://nlesc.gitbooks.io/guide/content/software/software_overview.html) for guidelines about software development.

The advantage of deep learning is that it can handle raw data directly, without the need to compute signal features.

Key Features: * Molecule and reaction valence bond representation. * Read and write file formats: SMILES, SDF, InChI, Mol2, CML, and others. * Efficient molecule processing algorithms: Ring Finding, Kekulisation, Aromaticity. * Coordinate generation and rendering. * Canonical identifiers for fast exact searching. * Substructure and SMARTS pattern searching. * ECFP, Daylight, MACCS, and other fingerprint methods for similarity searching. * QSAR descriptor calculations ## Install The CDK is a class library intended to be used by other programs, it will not run as a stand-alone program. The library is built with Apache Maven and currently requires Java 1.7 or later. From the root of the project run to build the JAR files for each module. The ``bundle/target/`` directory contains the main JAR with all dependencies included: ```bash $ mvn install ``` You can also download a pre-built library JAR from [releases](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/releases). Include the main JAR on the Java classpath when compiling and running your code: ```bash $ javac -cp cdk-2.9.jar MyClass.java $ java -cp cdk-2.9.jar:. MyClass ``` If you are using Maven, you can use the **uber** ``cdk-bundle`` to grab everything, note it is much more efficient to use include the modules you need: ```xml <dependency> <artifactId>cdk-bundle</artifactId> <groupId>org.openscience.cdk</groupId> <version>2.9</version> </dependency> ``` If you are a Python user, the Cinfony project provides access via [Jython](http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~noel/CDKJython.html). Noel O'Boyle's [Cinfony](http://cinfony.github.io/) provides a wrapper around the CDK and over toolkits exposing core functionality as a consistent API. `ScyJava` can also be used, as explain in [ChemPyFormatics](https://cdk.github.io/chempyformatics/). Further details on building the project in integrated development environments (IDEs) are available on the wiki: * [Building the CDK](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/wiki/Building-CDK) * [Maven Reporting Plugins](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/wiki/Maven-Reporting-Plugins) ## Getting Help The [Toolkit-Rosetta Wiki Page](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/wiki/Toolkit-Rosetta) provides some examples for common tasks. If you need help using the CDK and have questions please use the user mailing list, [``cdk-user@lists.sf.net``](mailto:cdk-user@lists.sf.net) (**you must [subscribe here]( https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/lists/cdk-user) first to post**). <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <project xmlns=""http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation=""http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd""> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <groupId>org.openscience.cdk</groupId> <artifactId>cdk</artifactId> <name>cdk</name> <description>Modular library for Cheminformatics</description> <version>2.12-SNAPSHOT</version> <packaging>pom</packaging> <url>http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/</url> <modules> <module>bundle</module> <module>base</module> <module>descriptor</module> <module>display</module> <module>misc</module> <module>storage</module> <module>tool</module> <module>legacy</module> <module>app</module> </modules> <properties> <argLine></argLine> <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding> <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding> <sonar.organization>cdk</sonar.organization> <sonar.language>java</sonar.language> <sonar.java.coveragePlugin>jacoco</sonar.java.coveragePlugin> <sonar.dynamicAnalysis>reuseReports</sonar.dynamicAnalysis> <!--suppress UnresolvedMavenProperty --> <sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths>${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}/bundle/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/jacoco.xml</sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths> <sonar.host.url>https://sonarcloud.io</sonar.host.url> </properties> <licenses> <license> <name>GNU LGPL 2.1 or later</name> <url>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</url> <distribution>repo</distribution> </license> </licenses> <scm> <url>https://github.com/cdk/cdk</url> <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/cdk/cdk.git</connection> <developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:cdk/cdk.git</developerConnection> </scm> <issueManagement> <url>https://github.com/cdk/cdk/issues</url> <system>SourceForge Tracker</system> </issueManagement> <!-- define the cdk.repo.url and cdk.repo.snapshots.url properties in ~/.m2/settings.xml --> <distributionManagement> <snapshotRepository> <id>ossrh</id> <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url> </snapshotRepository> <repository> <id>ossrh</id> <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/</url> </repository> <!-- site is staged and then copied to a sub-folder of gh-pages, no url is provided but the field is needed to stage the site. --> <site> <id>cdk.github.com</id> <url>https://cdk.github.io/cdk/</url> </site> </distributionManagement> <repositories> <repository> <id>ossrh</id> <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url> </repository> </repositories> <!-- developer = commit access --> <developers> <developer> <name>Christoph Steinbeck</name> </developer> <developer> <name>Egon Willighagen</name> <email>egonw@users.sf.net</email> <url>https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/</url> </developer> <developer> <name>Rajarshi Guha</name> </developer> <developer> <name>Miguel Rojas Cherto</name> </developer> <developer> <name>John Mayfield</name> <email>john@nextmovesoftware.com</email> <url>http://www.github.com/johnmay/</url> <timezone>GMT</timezone> </developer> </developers> <contributors> <contributor> <name>Sam Adams</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Jonathan Alvarsson</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Rich Apodaca</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Saravanaraj N Ayyampalayam</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Eric Bach</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Parit Bansal</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Ulrich Bauer</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Felix Bänsch</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Stephan Beisken</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Arvid Berg</name> </contributor> <contributor> <name>Lyle D.

Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The package has been developed and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv' <https://activinsights.com/>, binary (.gt3x) and .csv-export data from 'Actigraph' <https://theactigraph.com> devices, and binary (.cwa) and .csv-export data from 'Axivity' <https://axivity.com>. These devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity. Further, the package can handle accelerometer data file from any other sensor brand providing that the data is stored in csv format. Also the package allows for external function embedding.

It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable to a range of other instruments. See the `pipeline documentation`_ for details including `key features`_, installation instructions and a usage guide. An overview of the TraP can be found in the `TraP paper`_ accompanying release 2.0, and we also have an assigned ASCL ID (http://ascl.net/1412.011). If you make use of TraP in work leading to a publication, we ask that you cite these references. TraP development is coordinated by `The LOFAR Transients Key Science Project`_. Bug tracking and feature requests are handled through the repository `issue tracker`_. Contributions are welcome.

Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. # This CITATION.cff file was generated with cffinit. # Visit https://bit.ly/cffinit to generate yours today! cff-version: 1.2.0 title: GrainLearning message: >- If you use this software, please cite it using the metadata from this file. type: software authors: - given-names: Hongyang family-names: Cheng email: h.cheng@utwente.nl affiliation: University of Twente orcid: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7652-8600' - given-names: Luisa family-names: ' Orozco' email: l.orozco@esciencecenter.nl orcid: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9153-650X' affiliation: Netherlands eScience Center - given-names: Retief family-names: Lubbe email: r.lubbe@utwente.nl affiliation: University of Twente - given-names: Aron family-names: Jansen orcid: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4764-9347' affiliation: Netherlands eScience Center email: a.p.jansen@esciencecenter.nl - given-names: Philipp family-names: Hartmann email: philipp.hartmann@newcastle.edu.au orcid: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-8024' affiliation: University of Newcastle - given-names: Klaus family-names: Thoeni orcid: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7351-7447' affiliation: University of Newcastle email: klaus.thoeni@newcastle.edu.au identifiers: - type: doi value: 10.5281/zenodo.7123965 repository-code: 'https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/' url: 'https://grainlearning.readthedocs.io/' abstract: >- GrainLearning is a Bayesian uncertainty quantification and propagation toolbox for computer simulations of granular materials.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional Definitions. As used herein, ""this License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the ""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""The Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An ""Application"" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A ""Combined Work"" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the ""Linked Version"". The ""Minimal Corresponding Source"" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Provides high-level functions to access (read and write) and visualize surface-based brain morphometry data (e.g. cortical thickness) for individual subjects and groups. ![Vis](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/blob/master/surface/fsbrain_sulcal_depth_cbar_web.jpg?raw=true ""Sulcal depth visualization, created with fsbrain"") **Fig.1**: *Visualization of sulcal depth for a subject in FreeSurfer standard space (fsaverage).

It supports reading, writing, and visualizing various kinds of raw data and statistical results on brain surfaces and volumes. While the package provides a very convenient interface for working with data arranged in the standard [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) directory structure (SUBJECTS_DIR), *fsbrain* is not limited to this layout or FreeSurfer file formats. You can load brain meshes, volumes, and data from a range of other neuroimaging software packages and visualize them. The plots produced by *fsbrain* can be integrated into R notebooks or written to high-quality bitmap image files, ready for publication. The [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) renderer used by *fsbrain* provides fast, hardware-accelerated rendering based on the OpenGL standard. ## News * 2023-06-26: New fsbrain version 0.5.4 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2022-12-22: We are looking for help! If you have a Mac and are interested in helping fsbrain development, please [contact us by email](http://rcmd.org/ts/#contact) or reply to [#46](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/issues/46) here on GitHub! * 2022-02-13: New fsbrain version 0.5.3 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2021-11-11: New fsbrain version 0.5.1 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2021-09-16: New fsbrain version 0.5.0 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2021-05-12: New fsbrain version 0.4.3 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2021-03-28: New fsbrain version 0.4.2 released on CRAN, see the [CHANGES](./CHANGES). * 2020-09-20: The preprint of our paper [T. Schaefer, C. Ecker: fsbrain: an R package for the visualization of structural neuroimaging data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.302935)' is now available on biorxiv. ## Installation ### Recommended: install the stable fsbrain version from CRAN You can find the [fsbrain package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fsbrain), so all you need to do is: ```r install.packages(""fsbrain""); ``` In case something goes wrong, don't worry. Just install the missing [system dependencies](#system-dependencies) and retry. ### Risky: install the dev version of fsbrain with the latest features This version is not guaranteed to be in a usable state, try at your own risk and run the tests before using it. From an R session: ```r install.packages(c(""devtools"", ""knitr"", ""markdown"", ""rmarkdown"", ""testthat"", ""qpdf"")); devtools::install_github(""dfsp-spirit/fsbrain"", build_vignettes=TRUE); ``` ### System dependencies A *system dependency* is a **non-R** software that is needed for the installation of a package. System dependencies cannot be installed automatically using the R package system, so you need to install them manually or using the package manager of your operating system. The *fsbrain* package itself does not have any system dependencies, however, it uses *rgl* for rendering. You can check the *SystemRequirements* section on the [rgl page at CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) for the full list of rgl dependencies or read on. To get GIFTI format support, you will also need `libxml2-dev`. To install the system dependencies for *rgl* and *xml2*: #### Linux System dependencies (or: building from source) R packages are compiled from source by default under Linux, so you need some development libraries. Before installing *fsbrain*, run the following command in your system shell (not in R): * for deb-based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, ...): ```shell sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev libssh-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev libgfortran4 ``` Note: For recent Ubuntu versions, you may have to replace ```libgfortan4``` in the command above with ```libgfortan5```. * for rpm-based Linux distributions (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, ...): ```shell sudo yum install ImageMagick-c++-devel libX11-devel mesa-libGLU-devel freetype-devel libxml2-devel ``` If you want to compile the package under any other operating system, you will need the libraries as well, of course. #### MacOS System dependencies Recent MacOS versions do not ship with an X11 environment. You will have to install the [xquartz X11 system](https://www.xquartz.org/) if you do not have it already. If you want to create GIF movies, make sure you have imagemagick installed (easiest via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install imagemagick@6`). #### Windows Installation Hints Under Windows 10, it seems that you will need to install these two packages manually via the `install.packages` command: `shiny` and `manipulateWidget`. ### Installation via Docker There are Docker images for fsbrain available on Dockerhub, see the [fsbrain Dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/dfspspirit/fsbrain). ## Documentation The documentation can be accessed from within an R session after you have loaded the *fsbrain* package: * There are two online R Markdown notebooks (like Jupyter Notebook in Python) that show various example plots in combination with the code used to produce them: * [basic fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples.html): Live visualization of subject data * [advanced fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_adv.html): Plotting group data * [export API fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_export.html): Exporting publication-ready plots * Detailed vignettes with explanations and examples for the functions of the package is included, run `browseVignettes(""fsbrain"")` to see the vignettes. You can also open the vignette directly: * How to load and visualize surface-based neuroimaging data: `vignette(""fsbrain"")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain.html) * How to load and visualize volume-based neuroimaging data: `vignette(""fsbrain_vol"")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain_vol.html) * The fsbrain FAQ: `vignette(""fsbrain_faq"")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain_faq.html) * Help for a specific function can be accessed in the usual R manner: `?<function>`, where you replace `<function>` with a function name. Like this: `?group.morph.native`. * Run `example(<function>)` to see a live demo that uses the function `<function>`. Like this: `example(group.morph.native)`. * The [unit tests](./tests/testthat/) that come with this package are essentially a list of examples that illustrate how to use the functions. ## Unit tests and Continuous integration This package comes with [lots of unit tests](./tests/testthat/). To run them, in a clean R session: ```r library(devtools) library(fsbrain) devtools::check() ``` Continuous integration results: <!-- badges: start --> [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain) AppVeyor CI under Windows <!-- [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/actions) --> [GitHub Actions, Ubuntu Linux and MacOS](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/actions) (Note: Currently this is always ""failing"" because of a warning caused by the `rgl` package when running headless. So the simlpe ""passing""/""failing"" status is useless, and one needs to follow the link to check the relevant CI results in detail.) <!-- badges: end --> ## License The *fsbrain* package is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), published under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The figure below shows some examples for surface-based data: ![Visoverview](./web/fsbrain_vis_overview.jpg?raw=true ""Some visualization options from fsbrain"") **Fig.2**: *Example output for the fsbrain interactive visualization functions*. * **Subfigure A** shows the visualization of raw morphometry data (cortical thickness) from native space on the white surface of a subject. The view shows the data in tiles from 8 different angles. * **Subfigure B** illustrates arbitrary data (p-values in this case) visualized on the regions of the Desikan atlas, using the surface of the fsaverage (standard space template) subject from FreeSurfer. The view shows the data in tiles from 4 different angles. * **Subfigure C** displays the regions of the Desikan atlas on the white surface of a subject. The colors were loaded from the respective annotation file. The view shows the data in tiles from 4 different angles. *What* is displayed (morphometry data, atlas regions, arbitrary other data), on *which surface* it is displayed, and *how* it is displayed (a single interactive view, 4 tiles, 9 tiles) is independent and can be selected as needed in fsbrain. Here is a second figure, showing the same data (the [mean curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature) at each vertex) displayed on 3 different surfaces of a subject: **A** white surface, **B** pial surface, **C** inflated surface. ![Vissurfaces](./web/fsbrain_curvature_surfaces.jpg?raw=true ""Curvature visualization on different surfaces, rendered with fsbrain"") The next figure illustrates some options to visualize your results with different backgrounds. **A** Clusters on the white fsaverage surface with sulc background. **B** Region-wise p-values with curv background, inflated fsaverage surface. **C** A background color layer displaying outlines of aparc atlas regions in the respective colors, inflated demo subject surface. ![Visres](./web/fsbrain_vis_bg.jpg?raw=true ""Visualization of results and background layers, rendered with fsbrain"") ### Animations and videos Want to see brains spin? [Check this out.](./web/fsbrain_movies.md) (WARNING: loads 8 MB webpage with animated gif). ### Volume visualization Volume visualization is not the main goal of fsbrain, but standard lightbox views and simple 3D views are supported. Have a look at the vignettes or the documentation for the `volvis.lb` function. You can find some [example output here](./web/fsbrain_volume.md). ### Example Notebooks To see a combination of example figures and the code used to produce them, you should have a look at the example notebooks: [getting started notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples.html) and [advanced examples notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_adv.html). ## Contributing Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Open browser, go to ""http://localhost:9000"" Getting started (Linux, Debian and Ubuntu based) ------------------------------------------------- Prerequisites ------------ 1. nodejs, http://nodejs.org/ 2. bower, http://bower.io 3. compass, http://compass-style.org 4. Java Development Kit, https://www.java.com/ 5. PhantomJS v1 https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/ Installation ------------ ### Install nodejs Follow instructions at joyents github website: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions ### Install nodejs modules Install bower, karma-cli and grunt-cli globally ``` sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli karma-cli ``` ### Install compass Compass is used to convert the sass 2 css. 1. Install Ruby using https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt 2. Install Ruby dev and other dependecy packages ``` sudo apt-get install ruby-dev libffi-dev ``` 3. Install compass (for sass compilation) ``` gem install compass ``` ### Fetch git repository ``` git clone https://github.com/NLeSC/PattyVis ``` ### setup with bower ``` cd PattyVis npm install bower install ``` If you already have a installed the bower packages before, but need to update them for a new version of the code, run ``` bower update ``` ### start development server & open browser ``` grunt serve ``` Changes made to code will automatically reload web page. ### Run unit tests ``` grunt test ``` Generates test report and coverage inside `test/reports` folder. ### Run end-to-end tests with local browser (chrome) Tests in Chrome can be run with ``` grunt e2e-local ``` The pointcloud and minimap use a canvas and can't be tested automatically so they must be verified manually using the screenshots in the report. Open `e2e/reports/report.html` in a web-browser. ### Run end-to-end tests on [sauce labs](https://saucelabs.com/) To connnect to Sauce Labs use sauce connect program. [Here](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) you can find the details on how to install and run it. Before tests can be run the sauce labs credentials must be setup ``` export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your sauce labs username> export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your sauce labs access key> ``` Tests in Chrome, Firefox on Windows, Linux and OSX can be run with ``` grunt e2e-sauce ``` The pointcloud and minimap use a canvas and can't be tested automatically so they must be verified manually using the screencast in the report at `https://saucelabs.com/u/<your sauce labs username>`. Travis-ci also runs end-to-end tests on sauce labs. Note! Running `grunt e2e-sauce` will undo all changes in `app/` folder. ### Build a distro ``` grunt build ``` The `dist` folder has production ready distribution. ### Generate API documentation ``` grunt jsdoc ``` API documentation is generated in `doc/` directory.

The library provides an intuitive classes to prepare data, train a siamese model, and compute similarities between pairs of spectra. In addition to the prediction of a structural similarity, MS2DeepScore can also make use of Monte-Carlo dropout to assess the model uncertainty. ## Reference If you use MS2DeepScore for your research, please cite the following: **""MS2DeepScore - a novel deep learning similarity measure to compare tandem mass spectra""** Florian Huber, Sven van der Burg, Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Lars Ridder, 13, Article number: 84 (2021), Journal of Cheminformatics, doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00558-4 If you use MS2Deepscore 2.0 or higher please also cite: **Reliable cross-ion mode chemical similarity prediction between MS2 spectra** Niek de Jonge, David Joas, Lem-Joe Truong, Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Florian Huber bioRxiv 2024.03.25.586580; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.25.586580 ## Setup ### Requirements Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 (higher will likely work but is not tested systematically). ### Installation Installation is expected to take 10-20 minutes. ### Prepare environment We recommend to create an Anaconda environment with ``` conda create --name ms2deepscore python=3.9 conda activate ms2deepscore pip install ms2deepscore ``` Or, via conda: ``` conda create --name ms2deepscore python=3.9 conda activate ms2deepscore conda install --channel bioconda --channel conda-forge matchms pip install ms2deepscore ``` Alternatively, simply install in the environment of your choice by `pip install ms2deepscore` ## Getting started: How to prepare data, train a model, and compute similarities. We recommend to run the complete tutorial in [notebooks/MS2DeepScore_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/blob/main/notebooks/MS2DeepScore_tutorial.ipynb) for a more extensive fully-working example on test data. The expected run time on a laptop is less than 5 minutes, including automatic model and dummy data download. Alternatively there are some example scripts below. If you are not familiar with `matchms` yet, then we also recommand our [tutorial on how to get started using matchms](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee). ## 1) Compute spectral similarities We provide a model which was trained on > 500,000 MS/MS combined spectra from [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/), [Mona](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/), MassBank and MSnLib. This model can be downloaded from [from zenodo here](https://zenodo.org/records/13897744). Only the ms2deepscore_model.pt is needed. The model works for spectra in both positive and negative ionization modes and even predictions across ionization modes can be made by this model. To compute the similarities between spectra of your choice you can run the code below. There is a small example dataset available in the folder ""./tests/resources/pesticides_processed.mgf"". Alternatively you can of course use your own spectra, most common formats are supported, e.g. msp, mzml, mgf, mzxml, json, usi. ```python from ms2deepscore.models import load_model from matchms.Pipeline import Pipeline, create_workflow from matchms.filtering.default_pipelines import DEFAULT_FILTERS from ms2deepscore import MS2DeepScore model_file_name = ""ms2deepscore_model.pt"" spectrum_file_name = ""pesticides.mgf"" # load in the ms2deepscore model model = load_model(model_file_name) pipeline = Pipeline(create_workflow(query_filters=DEFAULT_FILTERS, score_computations=[[MS2DeepScore, {""model"": model}]])) report = pipeline.run(spectrum_file_name) similarity_matrix = pipeline.scores.to_array() ``` The resulting similarity matrix, is a numpy array containing all the MS2DeepScore predicitons between all spectra. ## 2 Create embeddings To calculate chemical similarity scores MS2DeepScore first calculates an embedding (vector) representing each spectrum. This intermediate product can also be used to visualize spectra in ""chemical space"" by using a dimensionality reduction technique, like UMAP. ```python cleaned_spectra = pipeline.spectra_queries ms2ds_model = MS2DeepScore(model) ms2ds_embeddings = ms2ds_model.get_embedding_array(cleaned_spectra) ``` The [tutorial](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/blob/main/notebooks/MS2DeepScore_tutorial.ipynb) shows how to use these embeddings to create an interactive UMAP with overlaying smiles. <img src=""https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/blob/main/materials/umap_example.png"" width=""400""/> ## 3) Train your own MS2DeepScore model Training your own model is only recommended if you have some familiarity with machine learning. You can train a new model on a dataset of your choice. That, however, should preferentially contain a substantial amount of spectra to learn relevant features, say > 100,000 spectra of sufficiently diverse types. Alternatively you can add your in house spectra to an already available public library, for instance the [data](https://zenodo.org/records/13934470) used for training the default MS2DeepScore model. To train your own model you can run the code below. Please first ensure cleaning your spectra. We recommend using the cleaning pipeline in [matchms](https://github.com/matchms/matchms). ```python from ms2deepscore import SettingsMS2Deepscore from ms2deepscore.wrapper_functions.training_wrapper_functions import train_ms2deepscore_wrapper spectrum_file = ""./combined_libraries.mgf"" # The settins below use default training settings and use precursor mz and ionmode as additional metadata input. # Have a look in the SettingsMS2Deepscore class to check other hyperparameters. settings = SettingsMS2Deepscore( additional_metadata=[(""CategoricalToBinary"", {""metadata_field"": ""ionmode"", ""entries_becoming_one"": ""positive"", ""entries_becoming_zero"": ""negative""}), (""StandardScaler"", {""metadata_field"": ""precursor_mz"", ""mean"": 0, ""standard_deviation"": 1000})],) train_ms2deepscore_wrapper(spectrum_file, settings, validation_split_fraction=20) ``` ## Contributing We welcome contributions to the development of ms2deepscore!

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. ""This License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ""Copyright"" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. ""The Program"" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". ""Licensees"" and ""recipients"" may be individuals or organizations. To ""modify"" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a ""modified version"" of the earlier work or a work ""based on"" the earlier work. A ""covered work"" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To ""propagate"" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To ""convey"" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays ""Appropriate Legal Notices"" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The ""source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. ""Object code"" means any non-source form of a work. A ""Standard Interface"" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The ""System Libraries"" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ""Major Component"", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The ""Corresponding Source"" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ""keep intact all notices"". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A ""User Product"" is either (1) a ""consumer product"", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, ""normally used"" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. ""Installation Information"" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. ""Additional permissions"" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ""further restrictions"" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An ""entity transaction"" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A ""contributor"" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's ""contributor version"". A contributor's ""essential patent claims"" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, ""control"" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a ""patent license"" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To ""grant"" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. ""Knowingly relying"" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is ""discriminatory"" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.} Copyright (C) {year} {name of author} This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: {project} Copyright (C) {year} {fullname} This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an ""about box"". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

Named after [the inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Lilius) of the [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). Lilio was originally designed for use in [`s2spy`](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy), a high-level python package integrating expert knowledge and artificial intelligence to boost (sub) seasonal forecasting. ## Installation [![workflow pypi badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lilio.svg?colorB=blue)](https://pypi.python.org/project/lilio/) [![supported python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/lilio)](https://pypi.python.org/project/lilio/) [![conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lilio/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lilio) To install the latest release of lilio, do: ```console python3 -m pip install lilio ``` Lilio is also available on conda-forge. If you use conda, do: ```console conda install -c conda-forge lilio ``` To install the in-development version from the GitHub repository, do: ```console python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio.git ``` ### Configure the package for development and testing A more extensive developer guide can be found [here](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/blob/main/docs/README.dev.md). The testing framework used here is [pytest](https://pytest.org). Before running the test, we get a local copy of the source code and install `lilio` via the command: ```py git clone https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio.git cd lilio python3 -m pip install -e .[dev] ``` Then, run tests: ```py hatch run test ``` ## How the lilio calendars work In Lilio, calendars are 2-dimensional. Each row (year) represents a unique observation, whereas each column corresponds to a precursor period with a certain lag. This is how we like to structure our data for ML applications. ![Conceptual illustration of Lilio Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4S2S/lilio/main/docs/assets/images/calendar_concept.png) We define the ""anchor date"" to be between the target and precursor periods (strictly speaking, it is the start of the first target interval). All other intervals are expressed as offsets to this anchor date. Conveniently, this eliminates any ambiguity related to leap years. Here's a calendar generated with Lilio: ```py >>> calendar = lilio.daily_calendar(anchor=""11-30"", length='180d') >>> calendar = calendar.map_years(2020, 2021) >>> calendar.show() i_interval -1 1 anchor_year 2021 [2021-06-03, 2021-11-30) [2021-11-30, 2022-05-29) 2020 [2020-06-03, 2020-11-30) [2020-11-30, 2021-05-29) ``` Now, the user can load the data `input_data` (e.g. `pandas` `DataFrame`) and resample it to the desired timescales configured in the calendar: ```py >>> calendar = calendar.map_to_data(input_data) >>> bins = lilio.resample(calendar, input_data) >>> bins anchor_year i_interval interval mean_data target 0 2020 -1 [2020-06-03, 2020-11-30) 275.5 True 1 2020 1 [2020-11-30, 2021-05-29) 95.5 False 2 2021 -1 [2021-06-03, 2021-11-30) 640.5 True 3 2021 1 [2021-11-30, 2022-05-29) 460.5 False ``` For convenience, Lilio offers a few shorthands for standard of calendars e.g. [`monthly_calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar_shorthands/index.html#lilio.calendar_shorthands.monthly_calendar) and [`weekly_calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar_shorthands/index.html#lilio.calendar_shorthands.weekly_calendar). However, you can also create custom calendars by calling [`Calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar/index.html#lilio.calendar.Calendar) directly. For a nice walkthrough, see [this example notebook](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/all_about_the_calendar.html). <!--- ## Tutorials `lilio` supports operations that are common in a machine learning pipeline of sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting research. Tutorials covering supported methods and functionalities are listed in [notebooks](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/tree/main/notebooks). To check these notebooks, users need to install [`Jupyter lab`](https://jupyter.org/). More details about each method can be found in this [API reference documentation](https://ai4s2s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/index.html). --> ## Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lilio/badge/?version=latest)](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) For detailed information on using `lilio` package, visit the [documentation page](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) hosted at Readthedocs. ## Contributing If you want to contribute to the development of lilio, have a look at the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). ## How to cite us [![rsd badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/RSD-lilio-blue)](https://research-software-directory.org/software/lilio) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/588084019.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/588084019) Please use the Zenodo DOI to cite this package if you used it in your research. ## Acknowledgements This package was developed by the Netherlands eScience Center and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam under Netherlands eScience Center grant NLESC.OEC.2021.005.

The platform facilitates a ""Great Bake Off"" of computational workflows in bioinformatics by integrating bioinformatics tools and metadata with technologies for automated workflow exploration and benchmarking. This enables a systematic and rigorous approach to the development of cutting-edge workflows, specifically in the field of proteomics, to increase scientific quality, robustness, reproducibility, FAIRness, and maintainability. The platform currently focuses on the proteomics domain. We aim to extend the platform to additional domains, e.g., metabolomics, genomics. Visit the live demo: http://workflomics.org/ ## Architecture The Workflomics web interface is part of a larger infrastructure that includes a Postgres database, a Postgrest API, a RESTful APE service, etc. The architecture is presented in the figure below: <div align=""left""> <img src=""https://github.com/Workflomics/.github/blob/main/draw.io/architecture_simplified.png"" alt=""architecture_workflomics"" width=""60%""> </div> ## Development For now, it is assumed you already have a Postgres database and Postgrest API set up and running. See [Deployment](#deployment) below for a docker compose configuration which starts all necessary services and initializes the database with the `.sql` scripts in the `database` folder. For development, a simple proxy server is run automatically when running `npm start` (through `setupProxy.js`, which is picked up by create-react-app). Configure the endpoints in a `.env` file in the project directory: ```bash API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:3000 APE_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4444 ``` Install the required modules for the front-end: ``` npm install ``` To start the front-end, simply run ``` npm start ``` ## Deployment ### Back-end services Copy `docker-compose.yml` to the server and in the same directory, create `.env`. In this file, configure accordingly: ``` POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> WF_DATA_DIR=<data directory> ``` The POSTGRES_PASSWORD is the password that is used to login to the Postgres database. The password can be set to anything the user wants, but it might be a good idea to use a password manager to generate a secure password and share it with other users that need access to hosted the database. The WF_DATA_DIR is the directory where the data is stored. At the moment, ports are hard-coded in the docker-compose.yml. To start the database, API to the database and RestAPE, run the following: ``` docker compose --env-file .env up -d # To remove the containers, run docker compose down ``` ### Nginx The front-end can be statically served, but requires a reverse proxy. For this, you could use nginx. A sample config is in the nginx folder, this is usually placed at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/workflomics.org.conf`. Make sure it is pointing to the proper back-end services and that there is a symlink to the config in `sites-enabled`. Nginx also statically serves the website as specified in the config. ### Building and deploying the front-end Make sure you are on the proper branch and have pulled any changes you want included. Build an optimized version of the application: ``` npm run build ``` This will build the application in the `build` directory. It can be statically served, for instance using nginx. For instance, using nginx, simply copy the contents of the `build/` directory to `/var/www/workflomics.org/`. { ""name"": ""Workflomics_frontend"", ""version"": ""1.1.0"", ""private"": true, ""dependencies"": { ""@mdi/js"": ""^7.3.67"", ""@mdi/react"": ""^1.6.1"", ""@testing-library/jest-dom"": ""^5.16.5"", ""@testing-library/react"": ""^13.4.0"", ""@testing-library/user-event"": ""^13.5.0"", ""@types/d3"": ""^7.4.0"", ""@types/jest"": ""^27.5.2"", ""@types/node"": ""^16.18.11"", ""@types/react"": ""^18.0.27"", ""@types/react-dom"": ""^18.0.10"", ""antd"": ""^5.23.1"", ""d3"": ""^7.8.5"", ""daisyui"": ""^2.49.0"", ""dotenv"": ""^16.0.3"", ""http-proxy-middleware"": ""^3.0.3"", ""mobx"": ""^6.7.0"", ""mobx-persist-store"": ""^1.1.3"", ""mobx-react-lite"": ""^3.4.0"", ""react"": ""^18.2.0"", ""react-dom"": ""^18.2.0"", ""react-router-dom"": ""^6.8.1"", ""react-scripts"": ""5.0.1"", ""typescript"": ""^4.9.4"", ""web-vitals"": ""^2.1.4"" }, ""scripts"": { ""start"": ""react-scripts start"", ""build"": ""react-scripts build"", ""test"": ""react-scripts test"", ""eject"": ""react-scripts eject"" }, ""eslintConfig"": { ""extends"": [ ""react-app"", ""react-app/jest"" ] }, ""browserslist"": { ""production"": [ "">0.2%"", ""not dead"", ""not op_mini all"" ], ""development"": [ ""last 1 chrome version"", ""last 1 firefox version"", ""last 1 safari version"" ] }, ""devDependencies"": { ""tailwindcss"": ""^3.2.4"" } } { ""compilerOptions"": { ""target"": ""es5"", ""lib"": [ ""dom"", ""dom.iterable"", ""esnext"" ], ""allowJs"": true, ""skipLibCheck"": true, ""esModuleInterop"": true, ""allowSyntheticDefaultImports"": true, ""strict"": true, ""forceConsistentCasingInFileNames"": true, ""noFallthroughCasesInSwitch"": true, ""module"": ""esnext"", ""moduleResolution"": ""node"", ""resolveJsonModule"": true, ""isolatedModules"": true, ""noEmit"": true, ""jsx"": ""react-jsx"" }, ""include"": [ ""src"" ] } Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION 1.

The website has been built with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), using [nuxt-content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for authoring stories and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) + [tailwind typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for styling. It is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://nuxtjs.org/deployments/github-pages/). ## Writing a story All stories are stored in the `static/stories` folder. Each story consists of a markdown file and a folder with some assets (images, etc.) belonging to the story. In addition to standard markdown, the `:::Chapter{}` directive is used to break the story into parts that can be displayed individually. An example story might look like this: `static/stories/example-story.md` ```markdown --- title: Example story author: Peter Kalverla et al., Netherlands eScience Center thumbnail: ""intro.png"" category: EUCP data and products trl: high id: 13 --- :::Chapter{headline=""Introduction"" image=""intro.png""} ## This is the first Chapter You can format text using markdown. The headline property will be used for the chapter navigation blocks. The image property will be used for the main display image of this chapter. Even though it's called 'image', you can also add standalone HTML pages, such as an exported mapbox file. The three colons below mark the end of the first chapter. ::: :::Chapter{headline=""Methods"" image=""concept.png""} ## This is the second Chapter and so on... ::: ``` This produces the following layout: ![Screenshot of example-story](example-story.png) The images should be stored in a directory with the same name as the story, but with a leading underscore, like so: ```bash - static/ - stories/ - example-story.md - _example-story/ - intro.png - concept.png ``` The frontmatter (title, author, etc.) will be used to show the story on the stories overview page. The ID and TRL (technical readiness level) properties are currently not used, but they are still here for legacy reasons. ## Adding your story to our collection If you want your story to be included on [eucp-project.github.io/storyboards](https://eucp-project.github.io/storyboards), you can make a pull request to this repository. We will review it and if everything is okay, we'll merge the story into the main branch. Continous deployment will then automatically update the site. If you want to add a story but are unsure about the github workflow, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We are happy to help. ## Serving the site locally You can also make a local build of the site, if you want to check that your story is formatted correctly before making a pull request. The following instructions are the default instructions from a new nuxt project. After cloning the repository: ```bash # install dependencies $ npm install # serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 $ npm run dev # build for production and launch server $ npm run build $ npm run start # generate static project $ npm run generate ``` For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org). # Reusing the storyboards format for a different project The source code (excluding the stories content) is licenced under Apache 2. You can fork this repo and add your own content, modify the styling, and do whatever you want. We'd appreciate it if you inform us about your re-using the software. We're also happy to help setting it up for you. # Reusing the storyboard materials The content of the storyboards is licenced under CC-BY 4.0. Please don't hesitate to contact the storyboard authors if you're interested in their work. { ""name"": ""storyboards"", ""version"": ""1.0.0"", ""private"": true, ""scripts"": { ""dev"": ""nuxt"", ""build"": ""nuxt build"", ""generate"": ""nuxt generate"", ""start"": ""nuxt start"", ""lint:js"": ""eslint --ext \"".js,.vue\"" --ignore-path .gitignore ."", ""lint"": ""npm run lint:js"" }, ""dependencies"": { ""@nuxt/content"": ""^1.14.0"", ""core-js"": ""^3.15.1"", ""nuxt"": ""^2.15.7"", ""remark-directive"": ""^1.0.1"", ""remark-sectionize"": ""^1.1.1"" }, ""devDependencies"": { ""@babel/eslint-parser"": ""^7.14.7"", ""@nuxtjs/eslint-config"": ""^6.0.1"", ""@nuxtjs/eslint-module"": ""^3.0.2"", ""@nuxtjs/tailwindcss"": ""^4.2.0"", ""@tailwindcss/typography"": ""^0.4.1"", ""eslint"": ""^7.29.0"", ""eslint-plugin-nuxt"": ""^2.0.0"", ""eslint-plugin-vue"": ""^7.12.1"", ""postcss"": ""^8.3.5"" } } Apache Software License 2.0 Copyright (c) 2022, Netherlands eScience Center Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/streetview-segmentation,"# Streetview segmentation Semantic image segmentation with Facebook's Mask2Former models. ## Description This script performs semantic segmentation on images, using models from Facebook's collection of Mask2Former models. Output consists of a CSV-file detailing, for each input image, the number of pixels in each semantic class in that image. Optionally, it can save a copy of each input image overlaid with the semantic segmentation. If the input images are 360° photo's, the script provides the possibility of tranforming them by projecting them onto a cube, resulting in six images per input image. This script is specifically designed to run on a computer without a GPU. Some of the underlying libraries require the presence of CUDA-drivers to run, even if the actual device is absent. As it can be problematic to install such drivers on a computer without an actual GPU, the program is packaged as Docker-container, based on an official NVIDIA-image, which comes with pre-installed drivers. Building and running the container requires the presence of [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Note that the container is based on a Linux image (Ububtu 18.04); running it on a Windows computer may require extra configuration. ## Building the docker container Check out this repository, and to build, run: ```bash docker build -t my_tag:latest -f Dockerfile . ``` ## Getting model files Models have two parts: configuration files, and a file with weights. The configuration files are located in the Mask2Former repository, which is included in the container at build time. Weights files are not included in the container; they must be downloaded and made available to the script in the container. After selecting the appropriate model configuration files and downloading the corresponding file with model weights, the location of both needs to registered in a configuration file. For example: ```json { ""path_model_cfg"" : ""/configs/coco/panoptic-segmentation/swin/maskformer2_swin_large_IN21k_384_bs16_100ep.yaml"", ""path_model_weights"" : ""/data/model/maskformer2_swin_large_IN21k_384_bs16_100ep/model_final_f07440.pkl"" } ``` See below for more detail on the paths. Save this to a configuration file, which will be passed to the script using the `--config` parameter. Please note that the software has been tested with a limited number of models, specifically one from the Mapillary Vistas Panoptic Segmentation collection (model_id 49189528_0), one from the COCO Panoptic Segmentation collection (47429163_0), and one from the Cityscapes set (48318254_2). Generally, the Swin-L based models seem to work properly. ### Model configuration Go the [Mask2Model Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md) and pick a model to use. Find the path of the model's configuration file by clicking the 'Mask2Former' link for the appropriate model in the Model Zoo-table. This leads to the corresponding configuration file in the Mask2Former repository. Take the path of that file relative to the repository's root, as it would be when the repository were checked out. Example: the first model from the COCO Model Zoo, Panoptic Segmentation-table (model_id 47430278_4) links to [its configuration in the Mask2Former repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former/blob/main/configs/coco/panoptic-segmentation/maskformer2_R50_bs16_50ep.yaml), the relative path of which, when checked out, would be: `Mask2Former/configs/coco/panoptic-segmentation/maskformer2_R50_bs16_50ep.yaml` This would be entered into the config file as: ```json ""path_model_cfg"" : ""/configs/coco/panoptic-segmentation/maskformer2_R50_bs16_50ep.yaml"", ``` #### External configuration If the configuration of a specific model is not present in the container (for example because it was added to the Model Zoo after the instance of the container was built), it can be made available to the script from a location outside of the container, much in the same way as a weights file (see next paragraph). Download the configuration file or files, make them available to the container via a volume mapping, and update the value for `path_model_cfg` accordingly. The script will first look for the absolute location as specified in `path_model_cfg`; if it doesn't exist, it will subsequently look in the Mask2Former repository. For example, if `path_model_cfg` is set to `/data/model/config/my_maskformer2.yaml` the script will first look in that literal path, which can be mapped to a folder on the host-machine. If that doesn't exist, it will look for `../Mask2Former/data/model/config/my_maskformer2.yaml` When using a external configuration, make sure to include *all* yaml-files required; model configurations are usually made up of several files, chained by \_BASE\_ statements. ### Weights-file A file with model weights needs to be downloaded and made available in the container. Click the appropriate 'model'-link in the Model Zoo-table to download the pickle-file containing the model. In the example above, this is `model_final_94dc52.pkl`. Place the file in a folder that will be mapped into the container, and edit the config file accordingly: ```json ""path_model_weights"" : ""/data/model/model_final_94dc52.pkl"", ``` Note that this should be the path as it is 'seen' from inside the container. ## Running a job Command to run a job: ```bash docker run -v /local/path/to/data:/data --rm -it my_tag:latest \ --config ""/data/model/config.json"" \ --non-recursive \ --input ""/data/images/in"" \ --output ""/data/images/out"" \ --transform360 \ --transform360exclude ""5"" \ --save-segmentation-images \ --suppress-warnings ``` The parameter `-v` maps a host directory to one inside the container, allowing the container access to files on the host computer. Mappings have the form of `<path on host>:<path in container>`; it's advised to always use '/data' for the second part. Parameters are as follows: + **config**: path to a JSON-file containing the model paths (mandatory; [example file](code/config.json.example)) + **input**: folder with images, or path to a single file (mandatory). By default, the folder is read recursively. + **output**: root folder to write output to (mandatory). + **non-recursive**: switch to force input folder to be read non-recursively (default: False). + **transform360**: order the program to transform the input photo's from 360° to six cube projections (default: False). If images should be processed _as is_, skip this flag. Transformed images are written to a subdirectory for each 360° image. + **transform360exclude**: comma-separated list of sides to exclude from the transformation. sides: 0 = left most, 1 = middle left, 2 = middle right, 3 = right most, 4 = top, 5 = bottom. For instance, `--transform360exclude ""4,5""` outputs four projected images, omitting the cube's top and bottom. + **save-segmentation-images**: whether the program has to save a copy of each image with the segmentation as overlay (default: False). Overlay images can be useful for checking results at a glance. They are saved in a subfolder with segmentations per model. Numerical output is always written to a CSV-file in the input folder. + **suppress-warnings**: suppress some of the warnings generated by the Mask2Former software (default: False). ### Known warnings Even when suppressing warnings, you may be presented with warnings when running a job. These can include + A warning about risks due to unsafe YAML-loading. As the only YAML-files loaded come from the Mask2Former repository, and are loaded inside a virtual environment, these can, under normal circumstances, be safely ignored. + A warning about a changed weight format from the Transformer Decoder. The weights are automatically converted to the correct format. ### Known issues Incidentally, the program has been observed to stop during the prediction phase, without any warnings or error messages. This is usually associated with a sharp increase in memory use, and can be solved by reducing the input images' size, or by using a different prediction model. ## Used libraries + [Mask2Former](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former) + [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) + [three60cube](https://pypi.org/project/three60cube/) ## A note on package versions Programs that work with CUDA can be sensitive to changes in versions of used packages. Even a change in the minor version of a package can sometimes cause serious problems. To avoid such problems, versions have been explicitly pinned to versions that have proved to work well together. However, after cloning the Mak2Former repository, [its requirements are installed](/UtrechtUniversity/streetview-segmentation/blob/main/Dockerfile#L39), none of which are pinned ([see requirements.txt](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former/blob/main/requirements.txt)). If this causes problems in the future, try uninstalling the packages and reinstalling them to the pinned versions listed below. + cython==0.29.30 + scipy==1.8.1 + shapely==1.8.2 + timm==0.6.5 + h5py==3.7.0 + submitit==1.4.4 + scikit-image==0.19.3"
